\section*{INTRODUCTION}
Organic chemistry is the study of the preparation, properties, identification, and reactions of those compounds of carbon not classified as inorganic. The latter include the oxide of carbon, the bicarbonates and carbonates of metal ions, the metal cyanides, and a handful of other compounds. There are several million known carbon compounds, and all but a very few are organic.\\
Virtually all plastics, synthetic and natural fibers, dyes and drugs, insecticides and herbicides, ingredients in perfumes and flavouring agents and all petroleum products are organic compounds. All the foods you eat consist chiefly of organic compounds in the famifies of the carbohydrates, fats and oils, proteins, and vitamins. The substances that make up furs and feathers, hides and skins, and all cell membranes are also organic.\\
Originally, the distinction between inorganic and organic substances was based on whether or not they were produced by living systems. For example, until the earty nineteenth century, it was believed that organic compounds had some sort of "life force" and could only be synthesized by living organisms. The view was dispelled in 1828 when German chemist Friedrich Wohler prepared urea from the inorganic salt ammonium cyanate by simple heating :\\
\includegraphics[max width=\textwidth, center]{2025_01_28_8470952b98110cec3aabg-003}

Since urea is a component of urine, it is clearly an organic material, yet there was clear evidence that it could be produced in the laboratory as well as by living things.

\section*{STRUCTURE AND SHAPES OF ORGANICMOLECULES:}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Tetracovalency of carbon: The atomic number of carbon is 6 and it has four electrons in its valence shell. In order to acquire stable inert gas configuration, it can share its electrons with the electrons of other to form four covalent bonds. Thus, carbon has a covalency of four or is tetracovalent. In 1874, Vant Hoff and Le Bel predicted that the four bonds of carbon in methane and other saturated compounds do not lie in a plane but are directed towards the four corners of a regular tetrahedral.\\

  \item Formation of organic molecules : We know that organic compounds are carbon compounds and carbon atom does not take part as such in bond formation but its $2 s$ and $2 p$ orbital(s) mix together to form new orbitals known as hybrid orbitals and the process in turn is known as hybridization. The types of hybridizations encountered in organic compounds are $s p^{3}$ (involved in saturated organic compounds containing only single covalent bonds, eg. methane), $s p^{2}$ (involved in organic compounds having carbon linked by double bonds, e.g. ethylene) and $s p$ (involved in organic compounds having carbon linked by a triple bond, e.g acetylenes). The bond angles and geometry associated with the three types of hybridization are summarized below:
\end{enumerate}

\end{center}

\begin{enumerate}
  \setcounter{enumi}{2}
  \item Types of bonds : Organic compounds normally contain only two types of carbon-carbon bonds, i.e, $\sigma$-(sigma) and $\pi$-(pi).\\
(i) Sigma bond:\\
(a) A carbon-carbon, $\sigma$-bond can be formed by overlap of two $s p^{3}, s p^{2}$ or $s p$-hybridized orbitals of carbon atoms.
\end{enumerate}

Alkanes and cycloalkanes contain only $s p^{3} \rightarrow s p^{3} \mathrm{C}-\mathrm{C}, \sigma$-bonds, alkenes contains $s p^{2}-s p^{2}, \mathrm{C}-\mathrm{C} \sigma$-bonds while alkynes contain $s p-s p, \mathrm{C}-\mathrm{C}, \sigma$-bonds.\\
(b) In a similar way, carbon can form sigma bonds with hydrogen atoms, while alkanes contain only $\mathrm{sp}^{3}-\mathrm{s}, \mathrm{C}-\mathrm{H} \sigma-$ bonds, alkenes contain $s p^{2}-s \mathrm{C}-\mathrm{H}, \sigma$-bonds and alkynes contain $\mathrm{sp}-\mathrm{s} \mathrm{C}-\mathrm{H}, \sigma$-bonds.\\
(ii) $\pi$-bond :\\
(a) A pi-bond is formed by sideways or lateral overlap of two $p$-orbitals, Thus, alkenes contain one $s p^{2}-s p^{2}, \mathrm{C}-\mathrm{C}$, $\sigma$-bond and one $\pi$-bond.\\
(b) In alkynes, the carbon atoms are $s p$-hybridized. Therefore, alkynes contain one $s p-s p, \mathrm{C}-\mathrm{C}, \sigma$-bond and two $\pi-$ bonds which are mutually perpendicular to each other.\\
(c) The two carbon atoms and two hydrogen atoms of acetylene molecule lie along a line with $\mathrm{C}-\mathrm{C}$ bond angle of $180^{\circ}$. Thus, acetylene is a linear molecule.\\
4. Effect of hybridization on bond length and bond strength : The bond length and bond strength of any bond depends upon the size of the hybrid orbitals involved.\\
(i) Bond lengths : Since a $p$-orbital is much bigger in size than a s-orbital of the same shell, therefore, as we go from $s p^{3}$ $\rightarrow s p^{2} \rightarrow s p$, the percentage of $p$-character decreases from $75 \rightarrow 66.7 \rightarrow 50 \%$.\\
Accordingly, the size of the orbital decreases in the same order: $s p^{3}>s p^{2}>s p$.\\
Since a bigger orbital forms a longer bond, therefore, $\mathrm{C}-\mathrm{C}$ single bond lengths decrease in the order:

$$
\begin{gathered}
\mathrm{C}\left(s p^{3}\right)-\mathrm{C}\left(s p^{3}\right) \\
1.54 \AA \\
\mathrm{C}\left(s p^{2}\right)-\mathrm{C}\left(s p^{2}\right) \\
1.34 \AA \\
1.20 \AA \mathrm{C}(s p)-\mathrm{C}(s p)
\end{gathered}
$$

(ii) Bond strengths:

Shorter the bond, greater is its strength. Thus, the $\sigma$-bond formed by sp-hybridized carbon is the strongest (i.e. maximum bond energy) while that formed by $s p^{3}$-hybridized carbon is the weakest (i.e. minimum bond dissociation energy). For example,

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
$\mathrm{C}(\mathrm{sp})-\mathrm{H}$ & $\mathrm{C}\left(s p^{2}\right)-\mathrm{H}>$ & $\mathrm{C}\left(s p^{3}\right)-\mathrm{H}$ \\
\hline
$121 \mathrm{kcal}^{\text {mol }}{ }^{-1}$ & $106 \mathrm{kcal}_{\mathrm{mol}}{ }^{-1}$ & $98.6 \mathrm{kcal} \mathrm{mol}^{-1}$ \\
\hline
$\mathrm{C}(\mathrm{sp})-\mathrm{C}(\mathrm{sp})>$ & $C\left(s p^{2}\right)-\mathrm{C}\left(s p^{2}\right)$ & $C\left(s p^{3}\right)-C\left(s p^{3}\right)$ \\
\hline
$200 \mathrm{kcal}^{\text {mol }}$-1 & $142 \mathrm{kcal}_{\text {mol }}{ }^{-1}$ & $80-85 \mathrm{kcal}_{\text {mol }}{ }^{-1}$ \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

Since the extent of overlap in sideways overlap is low, a carbon-carbon $\pi$-bond is always weaker than a carboncarbon $\sigma$-bond. A carbon-carbon double bond is, however, stronger than a carbon-carbon single bond since it consists

\begin{itemize}
  \item of a stronger $\sigma$-bond and a weak $\pi$-bond. In a similar way, a carbon-carbon triple bond is still stronger than carboncarbon double bond.
\end{itemize}

\begin{enumerate}
  \setcounter{enumi}{4}
  \item Types of carbon and hydrogen atoms : There are four types of carbon atoms :\\
(i) A primary $\left(1^{\circ}\right)$ carbon atom is bonded to either one more carbon atom or to none.\\
(ii) A secondary ( $2^{\circ}$ ) carbon atom is bonded to two other carbon atoms.\\
(iii) A tertiary $\left(3^{\circ}\right)$ carbon atom is bonded to three other carbon atoms.\\
(iv) A quaternary $\left(4^{\circ}\right)$ carbon atom is bonded to four other carbon atoms.
\end{enumerate}

The $1^{\circ}, 2^{\circ}, 3^{\circ}$ and $4^{\circ}$ carbon and $1^{\circ}, 2^{\circ}$ and $3^{\circ}$ hydrogen atoms are illustrated below :\\

\section*{STRUCTURAL REPRESENTATION OF ORGANIC COMPOUNDS:}
The structures of organic compounds can be represented in several ways. Commonly used methods to describe the structure of any organic compound are :\\
(a) Lewis formula (or Electronic formula) of a compound: The formula showing the mode of electron-sharing between different atoms in the molecule of a compound is called its electronic formula or Lewis formula.\\
Writing of the Lewis formula is primarily based on the octet rule (with certain exceptions).\\
To construct the Lewis formula for a molecule proceed as follows:\\
(i) Determine the total number of available outer electrons in the atoms that make up that molecule,\\
(ii) Arrange these electrons around the atoms so that each atom (except hydrogen) is surrounded by eight electrons (leave aside a few exceptions). The shared electrons are common to the two atoms. Hydrogen atom in any compound will have only two electrons.\\
$\mathrm{CH}_{4}:{ }_{6} \mathrm{C}$ contributes four electrons to bonding, each ${ }_{1} \mathrm{H}$ contributes one electron\\
\includegraphics[max width=\textwidth, center]{2025_01_28_8470952b98110cec3aabg-006(1)}

In acetylene (HCCH), for each carbon, two of the four bonding electrons are used in forming single bonds to one hydrogen and the other carbon. Two electrons are left over on each carbon, and these are shared to create a triple bond between the carbons.\\
\includegraphics[max width=\textwidth, center]{2025_01_28_8470952b98110cec3aabg-006}\\
(b) Structural formula : The formula showing the spatial arrangement of various atoms present in a molecule of the compound is called its structural formula. In other words, the formula showing the way various atoms are linked to each other in a molecule of any compound is called its structural formula. In structural formula, single bonds are shown by single lines $(-)$, double bonds are shown by double lines $(=)$, and triple bonds by three lines $(\xi)$. Such structural formulae are also called complete structural formulae. Thus, structural formula of a compound is its electronic formula in which one pair of shared electrons (.. or $x \cdot$ ) is replaced by a single bond, two pairs of the shared electrons (: : or : ${ }_{x}^{x}$ ) by a double bond, and three pairs of the shared electrons\\
(: $:$ or $\left.\sum_{x}^{x}\right)$ by a triple bond.\\
(c) Condensed structural formula : Structures can be abbreviated by omitting some or all of the covalent bonds and indicating the number of identical groups attached to an atom by a subscript. Such a compact formula is called condensed structural formula or simply as condensed formula. Thus methane can be represented as $\mathrm{CH}_{4}$ ethane as $\mathrm{CH}_{3}-\mathrm{CH}_{3}$.\\
(d) Bond line structural formula : Writing structural formulae for big complex organic molecule is both time and space consuming. Bond-line notation is a simple and convenient method of describing organic molecules. In this method.\\
(i) Bonds are represented by lines. Thus, single line $(-)$ represents a single bond, two parallel lines $(=)$ represent a double bond, and three parallel lines ( $\equiv$ ) represent a triple bond.\\
(ii) Carbon atoms are represented by the line-ends and line-intersections.

The termini denote a methyl group $\left(-\mathrm{CH}_{3}\right)$ unless indicated, otherwise by a functional group.\\
(iii) Functional group or any substituent may be shown at the appropriate place by using its symbol or formula.\\
(iv) Hydrogen atoms are assumed to be present in the required number so as to satisfy the tetravalency of carbon.

The bond-line structure for common compounds :\\
Cethane\\
(e) Three-dimensional representation : Covalent bonds are directional. Thus, bonds in an organic compound are oriented at certain angles to each other. The three-dimensional (3-D) structures of organic molecules cannot be visualized from two-dimensional structures written on paper. However, structures of the three-dimensional organic molecules can be shown on paper by using solid and dashed wedge method of describing organic molecules.\\
The following conventions are followed while writing solid and dashed wedge formulae.\\
(i) The solid wedge ( $\Delta$ ) is used to describe a bond projecting from the plane of the paper towards the observer.\\
(ii) The dashed wedge ( $V$ ) is used to describe a bond below the plane of the paper away from the observer.\\
(iii) The bond lying in the plane of the paper is shown by a normal line bond.

The solid and dashed wedge formula of methane is:\\

Aliphatic or open chain compounds : Those compounds in which first and last carbon atoms are not connected with each other. Branched or unbranched chains are possible in these compounds.\\
For example :\\

(unbranched)\\
\includegraphics[max width=\textwidth, center]{2025_01_28_8470952b98110cec3aabg-007(1)}

There are two varieties in these compounds-

\section*{Saturated hydrocarbons :}
(a) In such type, adjacent carbons are attached with single bonds.

Ex. $\mathrm{CH}_{3}-\mathrm{CH}_{2}-\mathrm{CH}_{3}$\\
(b) General formula of these compounds is $\mathrm{C}_{n} \mathrm{H}_{2 n+2}$ (alkane)\\
(c) These are also called as paraffins (Parum + Affinis i.e. little reactivity) because these are less reactive due to absence of $\pi$-bonds.

\section*{Unsaturated hydrocarbons:}
(a) There will be a double bond or a triple bond between any two carbons atoms.

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \mathrm{CH}_{2}=\mathrm{CH}-\mathrm{CH}_{3}, \quad \mathrm{CH} \equiv \mathrm{C}-\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\
& \text { Propene }
\end{aligned} \quad \text { Propyne }
$$

(b) General formula is $\mathrm{C}_{n} \mathrm{H}_{2 n}$ and $\mathrm{C}_{n} \mathrm{H}_{2 n-2}$\\
(c) Alkenes are also called as olefins because they react with halogens to form oily substances (Oleum + fenes i.e. Oil forming).\\
(d) Due to presence of $\pi$ bonds, these are more reactive

Cyclic or closed chain compounds : In these compounds first and last carbons are attached with each other.\\

Functional group : Organic compounds made up of only carbon and hydrogen are termed as hydrocarbons and they are parent organic compounds.\\
All other compounds are considered to have been derived from them by replacing one or more hydrogen by some other atom or group of atoms. These atoms or group are termed as functional group and they largely determine the chemical properties of the compound. The functional groups show their individual identity in their chemical reactions. Generally, compounds having same functional group show same chemical reactions. Some important functional groups are shown in the following table.

\begin{center}

\section*{HOMOLOGOUS SERIES:}
When structurally similar organic compounds are arranged in the order of increasing molecular weight, then the series of compounds so obtained is called a homologous series. The members of such a series are known as homologous of one another and this property is called homology.\\
Characteristics of Homologous Series :

\begin{enumerate}
  \item All the members of a homologous series can be represented by only one general formula.
  \item The members of a homologous series differ in their molecular weight by 14 or its multiple.
  \item The members of a homologous series differ in their molecular formulae by $\mathrm{CH}_{2}$ or its multiple.
  \item The members of a homologous series can be synthesised by some general methods of preparation.
  \item Physical properties of the members of a homologous series normally exhibit a regular gradual change with increase in molecular weight.
  \item The members of a homologous series normally exhibit similar chemical properties (reactions).
  \item Homologues cannot be isomers due to difference in their molecular formulae. Therefore, two or more than two isomers can never be included in the same homologous series.
\end{enumerate}

Ex.: Series\\
Alkane\\
Alkene\\
Alkyne\\
Alkanol\\
Alkanal\\
Alkanoic acid -

Alkylamines ( $1^{\circ}$ or primary amines), Dialkylamines ( $2^{\circ}$ or secondary amines) and Trialkylamines ( $3^{\circ}$ or tertiary amines) constitute different homologous series.

\section*{NOMENCEATURE:}
Mainly three systems are adopted for naming of organic compounds\\
(i) Common names or Trivial system\\
(ii) Derived system\\
(iii) IUPAC system

Initially organic compounds are named on the basis of source from which they were obtained.

\section*{IUPAC SYSTEM:}
IUPAC system of nomenclature of aliphatic compounds\\
According to IUPAC system, the name of an organic compound consists of three parts\\
(i) Word root\\
(ii) Suffix\\
(iii) Prefix\\
(i) Word root: Word root denotes the number of carbon atoms present in the principal chain which is the longest possible chain of carbon atoms. According to chain length, word root name up to $\mathrm{C}_{12}$ are given below.

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|}
\hline
Chain Length & Word Root & Chain Length & Word Root \\
\hline
$\mathrm{C}_{1}$ & Meth & $\mathrm{C}_{7}$ & Hept (a) \\
$\mathrm{C}_{2}$ & Eth & $\mathrm{C}_{8}$ & $\operatorname{Oct(a)}$ \\
$\mathrm{C}_{3}$ & Prop & $\mathrm{C}_{9}$ & Non(a) \\
$\mathrm{C}_{4}$ & But(a) & $\mathrm{C}_{10}$ & Dec(a) \\
$\mathrm{C}_{5}$ & Pent(a) & $\mathrm{C}_{11}$ & Undec (a) \\
$\mathrm{C}_{6}$ & Hex(a) & $\mathrm{C}_{12}$ & Dodec(a) \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

Extra ' $a$ ' given in parenthesis is used only if the primary suffix to be added to the word root starts with a consonant. Consonant-di, tri, tetra etc are not started with vowel, then extra ' $a$ ' has been added to the word root.\\
(ii) Suffix - Suffixes are of two types. Primary and secondary suffixes.\\
(a) Primary suffix - A primary suffix indicates the type of linkage in the carbon chain. If the carbon atoms are linked by single covalent bonds, the primary suffix is 'ane'. If these are linked by double and triple bonds, the primary suffixes 'ene' and 'yne' are respectively used to represent them. Thus, ane: primary suffix for $\mathrm{C}-\mathrm{C}$ bond ene: primary suffix for $\mathrm{C}=\mathrm{C}$ bond yne: primary suffix for $\mathrm{C} \equiv \mathrm{C}$ bond\\
If the parent chain of carbon atoms contains more than one double or triple bonds, numerical prefixes like di (for two), tri (for three) tetra (for four) etc. are added to primary suffix.\\
Example -

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{llll}
Hydrocarbon & Word root & Primary suffix & IUPAC name \\
$\mathrm{CH}_{3}-\mathrm{CH}_{2}-\mathrm{CH}_{2}-\mathrm{CH}_{3}$ & But & ane & Butane \\
$\mathrm{CH}_{2}=\mathrm{CH}-\mathrm{CH}=\mathrm{CH}_{2}$ & Buta$^{*}$ & diene & Butadiene \\
$\mathrm{CH}_{3}-\mathrm{C} \equiv \mathrm{CH}$ & Prop & yne & Propyne \\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

(b) Secondary suffix: A secondary suffix is used to represent the functional group if present in organic molecule and is attached to the primary suffix while writing its IUPAC name. Secondary suffixes of some of the functional groups are:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}
\hline

While adding a secondary suffix to the primary suffix, the terminal ' $e$ ' of the primary suffix (ane, ene, or yne) is dropped if the secondary suffix begins with ' $a^{\prime}$ ', $i^{\prime}$ ' $\mathrm{o}^{\prime}$ ' $u$ ' or ' $\mathbf{y}$ '. In case, it begins with consonant, then the terminal ' $e^{\prime}$ of the primary suffix is retained.\\

Propane and butane are the IUPAC names of acyclic compounds while cyclopropane and cyclobutane are for cyclic compounds.\\
(b) Secondary prefix - In the IUPAC system of nomenclature, certain characteristic groups are not considered as or secondary suffixes. These are regarded as substituents and are denoted by secondary prefixes. The secondary prefixes of a few substituents are given-\\

General rules for naming long chain aliphatic compounds : Many organic compounds contain long chains which may include substituents, multiple bonds and functional groups. The IUPAC names of such compounds are based on certain general rules.\\
Rules for IUPAC nomenclature of straight and branched chain alkanes : In writing the IUPAC name of an aliphatic compounds the following sequence is used. Secondary prefix + primary prefix + word root + primary suffix + secondary suffix

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Longest chain rule-Select the longest continuous chain of carbon atoms in a given molecule of alkane which need not be straight. It is known as parent chain or principal chain.\\
\includegraphics[max width=\textwidth, center]{2025_01_28_8470952b98110cec3aabg-019(1)}
\end{enumerate}

Parent chain has six carbon atoms and $\mathrm{CH}_{3}$ group represents the substituent\\
If two chains of equal lengths are possible, then the one with more number of side chains (or substituents) represents the parent chain. For example,\\
\includegraphics{smile-4d19bb2ab14985fbb098e3fea672371ea719e01d}\\
(Parent chsin of sic carbon atom has ane cubstithent) Wron?\\
\includegraphics[max width=\textwidth, center]{2025_01_28_8470952b98110cec3aabg-019}\\
(Pafent cliain of sic carbon atoms has two substimentst Kight\\
2. Lowest number rule - For molecules with only one substituent, number the carbon atoms as $1,2,3,4 \ldots \ldots$. etc. in the parent chain starting from one end in sucha way that the carbon atom carrying the substituent gets the lowest number.\\
\includegraphics{smile-21da64147963a1ef64e5cc22eb8aa1ad496bc50f}

The numbering of parent chain is correct because\\
$\mathrm{CH}_{3}$ group is attached to $\mathrm{C}-3$ atom\\
\includegraphics{smile-7778c06c05bb38204887bf2c2105cee6d313d307}

The numbering of parent chain is incorrect

The number which indicates the position of the substituent (or side chain) in the parent chain is called its position number or locant. The name of the substituents is separated from its locant by hyphen $(-)$ and the final name of the alkane is always written as one word i.e. 3-methylheptane. In case, same alkyl group occurs more than once at different positions in the parent chain, the positional number of each alkyl group is separated by commas and suitable prefixes like di (for two), tri (for three) tetra (for four) etc. are attached to the name of the alkyl groups.\\
3. Lowest set of locants rule - In case, there are two or more substituents, then the parent or principal chain is numbered from the end which gives the lowest set of locants. This rule (IUPAC 1993) replaces the lowest sum rule used earlier. When two or more substituents are present in a molecule, then the end of the parent chain which gives the lowest term at the first point of difference in the set of locants is considered for numbering the carbon atoms in the parent chain.

Ex.\\
\includegraphics{smile-fd958f065ee02fd41d29a18b67f07e156a81c4d5}

Set of locants : 2, 4,9 locants Correct\\
\includegraphics{smile-0709ae9e8b85bb11bf01315c60d3b9ec5f5ced40}

Set of locants : $2,7,9$ locants Wrong\\
Alphabetical order for the side chain (or substituents) - When two or more different alkyl groups (side chains or substituents) are present on the parent chain. Such groups prefixed by their locants (or positional numbers) are arranged in alphabetical order irrespective of their positional number, before the name of the parent alkane. For example,\\
\includegraphics[max width=\textwidth, center]{2025_01_28_8470952b98110cec3aabg-020}

It may be remembered that the prefixes di, tri, tetra are not considered in case the same alkyl group occurs more than one on the parent chain at different positions while arranging them in an alphabetical order. For example,\\
\includegraphics{smile-95312794c16f67a554f0bd87e70d94ddeb4d7c02}

3-Ethyl-2.3-dimethylpentane\\
Naming the different substituents at equivalent positions - If two different substituents are present at equivalent positions from the two ends in the parent chain, then the numbering of the chain is done in such a way that the substituent which comes first in the alphabetical order gets the lower number. For example\\
\includegraphics{smile-9afdbe6eeebc88ad856010be37f98bf62bdfe04c}

3-Ethyl-4-methylhexane hamsend\\
4. Naming the complex substituents or alkyl groups:\\
(a) An alkyl group is said to be complex in case one or more carbon atoms in it are further substituted i.e., it is a substituted substituent (or alkyl group). It is named as a substituted alkyl group by numbering from the carbon atom of this group attached to the parent chain as " 1 ". The name of the complex substituent is generally enclosed in brackets in order to avoid any confusion with either numbering the parent chain or naming the other substituents attached to the chain. For example:\\
\includegraphics{smile-ed1c8218c3461fd684b7c4b14cc1946c88bd727c}

4-(1,1-dimethyiethyl) heptane\\
(b) It may be noted that while deciding the alphabetical order of the various substituents, the name of the complex substituent is considered to begin with the first letter of its complete name. For example-\\
\includegraphics[max width=\textwidth, center]{2025_01_28_8470952b98110cec3aabg-021}\\
(c) When the names of the complex substituents are composed of identical words, the priority is decided by comparing the locant at the first cited point within the complex substituents. This means that the complex substituent gets lower priority which has the lowest locant. For example\\
\includegraphics[max width=\textwidth, center]{2025_01_28_8470952b98110cec3aabg-021(2)}

5-(1-methylpropyl)-6-(2-methylpropyl) decane\\
In this case, 1-methylpropyl gets priority over 2-methylpropyl since the locant for the methyl substituent in the first case is less.

\section*{NOTE}
(a) Initially w rite the number of that carbon on which the side chain is attached, then write it in alkyl group.\\
(b) If there are more than one side chains (same) initially write the numbers altogether using symbol (). in between them, after last number use the symbol hyphen $(-)$. Write the numbers in increasing order.

Ex.\\
\includegraphics{smile-242bf84f71365b6c75a4652604fd62e4201b762e}

2,3,4-trimethylpentane\\
(c) IUPAC name is written according to english alphabates (strictly).\\
\includegraphics[max width=\textwidth, center]{2025_01_28_8470952b98110cec3aabg-021(1)}

\section*{2-methyl-4-isopropyl-5-ethylheptane (wrong) \\
 5-ethyl-4-isopropyl-2-methylheptane (right)}
(d) Capital word is used for first substituent.

Ex.\\

3-Amino-4-ethyl-2-methylhexane (more correct)

\section*{Rule in IUPAC nomenclature of unsaturated hydrocarbons (alkenes and alkynes)}
In writing the IUPAC name of a particular member of the alkene or alkyne family, the primary suffix, 'ane' of corresponding alkane is replaced by the sulfix 'ene' or 'yne' respectively.

\begin{enumerate}
  \item The parent chain must include the multiple bond regardless of the fact whether it is longest continuous chain or not. For example,\\
\includegraphics{smile-af8c3e14c262b50e05b2da39caf69281e0b2f9b3}
  \item The numbering of the parent chain must be done in such a way that the first $C$-atom involved in the multiple bond gets the lowest number. According to the latest IUPAC convention, the locants for the multiple bonds (double or triple bonds) are placed immediately before the primary suffixes (ene or yne) which they represent. The earlier practice was to place the locant either before the word root (e.g., 2-butene) or after the name of the primary suffix (e.g., butene-2) but it is not regarded as proper. For example,\\
\includegraphics{smile-eaa462b167d5953ffbaa06ce124c24f34c8ddeb3} But-2-enc
  \item If the selected principal or parent chain contains two (or three) double or triple bonds, then the primary suffix-diyne (or triene) or -diene (or triyne) are used to represent these. In all these cases, terminal ' $a$ ' is also added to the word root. For example,
  \item If the parent chain includes both double and triple bonds, then the following points must be kept in mind.\\
(a) the unsaturated compound is always named as a derivative of alkyne i.e., primary suffix 'ene' always comes before 'yne'. In all such cases, the terminal ' $e$ ' of 'ene' is dropped if it is followed by the suffix starting with a, i, o, u or y. For example,
\end{enumerate}

$$
\begin{gathered}
\mathrm{CH}_{-}-\mathrm{CH}=\mathrm{CH}-\mathrm{C}^{2}=\mathrm{CH}=\mathrm{CH}-3 \text {-en- } 4 \text {-yne }
\end{gathered}
$$

(b) In case, the numbering from two different ends gives two different sets of locants, then the lower set of locants is preferred. For example,

$$
\stackrel{6}{\mathrm{C}} \mathrm{H}_{3}-\stackrel{5}{\mathrm{C}} \equiv \stackrel{+}{\mathrm{C}}-\stackrel{\mathrm{C}}{\mathrm{C}} \mathrm{H}_{2}-\stackrel{2}{\mathrm{C}} \equiv \stackrel{1}{\mathrm{C}} \mathrm{H}
$$

Hexa-1, 4 -diyne and nor hexa-2, 5-diyne\\
5. If the unsaturated hydrocarbon contains a side chain (or substituent) along with the multiple bonds, then the numbering of the parent or principal chain is done in such a way that the multiple bond gets the lowest set of locants. However, if the numbering from both ends gives the same set of locants to the multiple bonds, then the locant for the substituent must be minimum. For example,

$$
\begin{gathered}
\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\
\stackrel{+}{\mathrm{C}} \mathrm{H}_{2}=\stackrel{+}{\mathrm{C}} \mathrm{H}-\mathrm{C}_{\mathrm{C}}^{\mathrm{C}} \mathrm{H} \\
\text { 2-Methylbuta-L 3-diene } \\
\text { (Minimum locant for the } \mathrm{CH} \\
3
\end{gathered}
$$

$1 \quad 2 \stackrel{\mathrm{CH}_{3}}{13} 4_{4}$\\
$\mathrm{HC} \equiv \mathrm{C}-\mathrm{CH}-\mathrm{C} \equiv \mathrm{CH}$\\
3-Methylpenta-1,4-diyne

In some cases, more than two double bonds are present in the hydrocarbon and it is not possible to include all of them in the parent chain. In such cases, the following prefixes are used for the double bonded groups not involved in the chain.\\
$\mathrm{CH}_{2}=$\\
$\mathrm{CH}_{3}-\mathrm{CH}=$\\
$\mathrm{CH}_{2}=\mathrm{CH}-$\\
(Vinyl or ethenyl)\\
$\mathrm{CH}_{2}=\mathrm{CH}-\mathrm{CH}_{2}-$\\
(Allyl)

Nomenclature of monofunctional compounds : Compounds having one functional group are called monofunctional compounds. The various rules are:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item That longest chain is selected which contains functional group, even if other chain contains more number of carbon atoms.\\
If the functional group contains a carbon atom, that atom is also counted as a part of the chain.\\

  \item When more than one same functional groups are present, the carbon chain which contains maximum number of functional group is selected.\\
\includegraphics[max width=\textwidth, center]{2025_01_28_8470952b98110cec3aabg-023}
  \item When the functional g. oup does not have carbon atom then the carbon atom to which the functional group is attached should be included in the main chain.\\
\includegraphics{smile-0109eddd72f35dbda6283f35735f1142c3dea5f7}
  \item The selected carbon chain is numbered from that end to which the functional group is nearer.\\
\includegraphics{smile-d36b8deb34db6bcbdd0c78430fd5279cf93fd845}
  \item If the functional group is at the same distance from both the ends, then numbering is done from the end in which the substituent is nearer.\\
\includegraphics{smile-21723bae0da3cc8adf43f23f7e7a3fb65337480e}
  \item While writing name of the compound, the name of functional group along with its position is represented by suitable suffix and all the substituents are represented by suitable prefixes in their alphabetical order.\\

In writing the IUPAC name of a polyfunctional compound, the functional group with the maximum preference (principal functional group) is represented by the secondary suffix which is added to the word root along with the primary suffix. All other secondary functional groups if present, are indicated by suitable prefixes which are added to the root word. (In alphabatic order)\\
Thus, a functional group can act either as a secondary suffix or a prefix depending upon its priority in the priority sequence. A functional group, in fact, has two names; one while acting as secondary suffix and the other while acting as a prefix.

Suppose an organic compound contains both - CHO and - COOH groups attached on both sides of the carbon atom chain. Then- COOH group is regarded as the principal functional group and its secondary suffix is oic acid. At the same time, -CHO group is the substituent and its prefix is formyl as shown below :\\
\includegraphics[max width=\textwidth, center]{2025_01_28_8470952b98110cec3aabg-026}

The IUPAC name of the compound is : 4-Formylbutanoic acid.\\
If the organic compound contain more than one similar complex substitutent, then the numerical prefix di, tri, tetra, extra replaced by bis, tris, tetrakis, etc. respectively.\\
\includegraphics{smile-5b7bf5aea28dcb2fe370c0cf80f6e57611ff4b91}\\
1.1.1-Trichloro-2.2-bis (4-chlorophenyl) ethane

If two substituents of the same priority occupy identical positions from either end of the parent chain, lower number must be given to the substituent whose prefix comes first in the alphabetical order. Thus, when Br and Cl atoms are present at the equivalent positions in a chain, then the carbon atom having Br is numbered lower,\\

\section*{NOMENCLATUREOF AROMATIC COMPOUNDS}
Aromatic is regarded as aroma means pleasant smell. Aromatic compounds may be classified into two main types. These are benzenoids and non-benzenoids. They may be nuclear substituted and side-chain substituted\\
(i) Nuclear substituted : Those in which the functional group is directly attached to the benzene ring. In the IUPAC system, they are named as derivatives of benzene. The positions of the substituents in disubstituted benzenes are indicated either by prefixes or by arabic numerals such as $o$-(ortho) for 1,$2 ; m$-(meta) for 1,3 and $p$-(para) for 1,4 . For tri and higher substituted benzene derivatives, the positions of the substituents are indicated only by arabic numerals.\\
(ii) Side-chain substituted : Those in which the functional group is present in the side chain of the benzene ring. In the common as well as IUPAC systems, these are usually named as phenyl derivatives of the corresponding aliphatic compounds (except arenes which are named as derivatives of benzene in the IUPAC system). The positions of the substituents on the side chain including the benzene ring are indicated by Greek letters i.e., $\alpha, \beta, \gamma \ldots$ etc, in the common system, and by arabic numerals, i.e. $1,2,3$......etc. in the IUPAC system. However, many of these compounds are better known by their common names.

\section*{BENZENOIDS:}
These are cyclic compounds which contain either one or more benzene rings. A few examples of benzenoids are as follows.\\

Anthracene

It may be noted that the presence of double bonds in the alternate positions is not the sole criteria for a compound to be aromatic. For example, cyclooctatetraene contains alternate single and double bonds, but it is not aromatic.\\

Cyclooctatetraene\\
Non-benzenoids : Certain compounds do not contain a benzene ring but they fulfill the characteristics of aromatic compounds. These are called non-benzenoids. Some heterocyclic compounds belong to this class of aromatic compounds. For example,\\

Nomenclature of benzenoids : Benzene $\left(\mathrm{C}_{6} \mathrm{H}_{6}\right)$ is a hexagonal ring of carbon atoms with single and double bonds in the alternate positions. This ring is also called nucleus. In case any one or more hydrogen atoms attached to the carbon atoms of the ring are substituted by some alkyl ( R ) groups or other functional group, then such groups form the side chains.\\

Monosubstituted : Since all the carbon atoms in the ring are identical, by replacing any one of the hydrogen atoms only one mono substituted derivative will be formed.\\

\section*{NAMING ALICYCLIC COMPOUNDS:}
Monocyclic compounds : The name of alicyclic compounds are based on the following rules.

\begin{enumerate}
  \item The names of the alicyclic compound are obtained by adding the primary prefix 'cyclo' to the word root that corresponds to the number of carbon atoms in the ring.\\
For the cyclic compounds containing all single bonds in the ring, primary suffix 'ane' is added to the word root. For those containing one double or triple bond, the primary suffix ene or yne is added.\\
\includegraphics[max width=\textwidth, center]{2025_01_28_8470952b98110cec3aabg-033(1)}\\

Cyclopentene\\
\includegraphics{smile-a228bb256db58ad95e060eae9a00f3844608b390}\\
Cyclohexent
  \item If only one substituent is attached to the ring, its position is not mentioned. If two or more substituents are present, their positions are indicated by arabic numerals i.e., 1,2,3,4 $\qquad$ etc. which are used for numbering the carbon atoms in the ring. The numbering is done in such a way (clockwise or anticlockwise) that the substituents get the lowest set of locants. All other rules relating to aliphatic or acyclic compounds are then followed. For example,\\
\includegraphics{smile-2862b6f6e483dd0f89284ca900edb370a5745445}
\end{enumerate}

Methylcyclopentane\\
\includegraphics{smile-defd8c5f41b15bdb85ae4796aa1e87361ed6ca40}

1-Ethyl-2-methylcyclopentane\\
3. If a multiple bond and some other substituents are present in the ring, the numbering is done in such a way so as to assign lowest number to the multiple bond. For example,\\
\includegraphics{smile-6d343eed645bd208b67bc4248a4bf18440f131dc}

2-Ethyl-3-methylcyclopent-1-ene\\
\includegraphics{smile-f7270e7bfdbcb4980be3332cd85b5b0a8170c5c3}

3-Nitrocyclohex-1-ene\\
4. In case, some functional group along with some substituents are present in the ring, the numbering of the carbon atoms should be done in such a way that the functional group gets lowest number.\\
\includegraphics{smile-aac330458a46b81bd404a3e9b503858f8fae4bef}\\

\includegraphics{smile-1bdf190fb6b41ee6e33b83c7ad0b904ed5e138da}

In case, the functional group directly attached to the ring contains carbon atom, suitable suffixes are used to represent such a group.\\

5. If the ring contains lesser carbon atoms than the alkyl group attached to it, the compound is named as the derivative of alkane and the ring is treated as cycloalkyl substituent. Otherwise, it is named as the derivative of cycloalkane. For example.\\

In case, the side chain contains a multiple bond or a functional group, the alicyclic ring is treated as the substituent irrespective of its size. For example,\\

\includegraphics{smile-14c5e1327d6fa730463d2c21d303d40eb4bd5bbf}\\
6. If the ring contains fewer carbon atoms than the alkyl group attached to it or when more than one ring system is attached to a single chain the compound is named as a derivative of alkane and the ring is treated as cycloalkyl substituent.\\
7. When both ring as well as side chain contains the sam\& functional group, then the parent hydrocarbon is decided on the basis of the number of carbon atom.\\
8. If a compound contains a cyclic ring as well as a benzene ring, it is named as a derivative of benzene.

Nomenclature of Bicyclic Compounds:\\
(a) Many hydrocarbons and their derivatives contain two fused or bridged rings.\\
(b) The carbon atoms common to both rings are called bridge head atoms and each bond or chain of carbon atoms connecting both the bridge head atoms is called as bridge.\\
(c) The bridge may contain $0,1,2 \ldots$ etc. carbon atom. For example,\\
\includegraphics[max width=\textwidth, center]{2025_01_28_8470952b98110cec3aabg-034}\\

\includegraphics{smile-440429d18c5ca00817e47d59e63307e392ac6a17}\\
(d) These bicyclic compounds are named by attaching the prefix 'bicyclo' to the name of the hydrocarbon having the same total number of carbon atoms as in the two rings.\\
(e) The number of carbon atoms in each of the three bridges connecting the two bridge head carbon atoms is indicated by arabic numerals, i.e. $0,1,2, \ldots$ etc. These arabic numerals are arranged in descending order;separated from one another by full stops and then enclosed in square brackets.\\
(f) The complete IUPAC name of the hydrocarbon is then obtained by placing these square brackets containing the arabic numerals between the prefix bicyclo and the name of the alkane. For example,\\

\section*{NAMES OF SPIRO HYDROCARBONS}
(a) Spiro bicyclic hydrocarbons contain two rings consisting of carbon atorns only the two rings are linked by a common carbon. These compounds are named by placing prefix 'spiro' before the name of the acyclic parent hydrocarbon with same number of skeleton carbon atoms. The numbers of skeleton atoms linked to the spiro atom are indicated by arabic numbers, separated by a full stop. The numbers are written in ascending order and enclosed in square brackets. Numbering of a spiro bicyclic hydrocarbon starts with a ring carbon next to the spiro atoms and proceeds first through the small ring and then through the spiro atom and around the second ring. Some examples are given below :\\

(b) IUPAC nomenclature of unbranched assemblies consisting of two or more identical hydrocarbon units joined by a single bond. These systems are named by placing a suitable numerical prefix such as bi for two, ter for three, quarter for four, quinque for five etc. before the name of the repetitive hydrocarbon unit. Starting from either end, the carbon atoms of each repetitive hydrocarbon unit are numbered with unprimed and primed arabic numerals such as $1,2,3 \ldots, 1^{\prime}, 2^{\prime}$, $3^{\prime} \ldots ., 1^{\prime \prime}, 2^{\prime \prime}, 3^{n} \ldots$ etc. The points of attachment of the repetitive hydrocarbon units are indicated by placing the appropriate locants before the name.

Give IUPAC name of alkane compound : $\mathrm{CH}_{3}-\mathrm{CH}=\mathrm{CH}-\mathrm{CH}_{2}-\mathrm{C} \equiv \mathrm{C}-\mathrm{CH}_{2}-\mathrm{CH}_{3}$\\
Sol. The longest chain contains 8 carbons. So, the parent alkane is octane. Numbering of the chain is done from the end nearer to the carbon having double bond. Thus,

$$
{ }^{1} \mathrm{CH}_{3}-{ }^{2} \mathrm{CH}={ }^{3} \mathrm{CH}-4^{4} \mathrm{C}_{2}-{ }^{-} \mathrm{C} \equiv 6 . \mathrm{C}^{6}-\mathrm{CH}_{2}-{ }^{8} \mathrm{CH}_{3}
$$

The compound contains one double and one triple bond. So, the suffix would contain both the suffixes ene and yne. Indicating their positions in the chain, the suffix is 2-en-5-yne. So, the molecule is named as, oct-2-en-5-yne.

EFimpl257 6:

Name the compound:\\
\includegraphics{smile-4cdb1b6e72f08108ae82af08aeca6c5e88d4f098}

Sol. The molecule has a tert-butyl group bounded to a nine-membered cycloalkane. It is tert-butylcyclononane. Alternatively, the tert-butyl group could be named systematically as a 1,1-dimethylethyl group, and the compound would then be named\\
(1,1-dimethylethyl) cyclononane. (Parentheses are used when necessary to avoid ambiguity. In this case the parentheses alert the reader that the locants 1,1 refer to substitutents on the alkyl group and not to ring positions.)\\

\section*{ISOMERISM}
Different organic compounds with the same molecular formula but different physical and chemical properties are called isomers and the general phenomenon is known as isomerism. It is classified as follows.\\
Classification or types of isomerism :\\
ISOMERISM\\
\includegraphics[max width=\textwidth, center]{2025_01_28_8470952b98110cec3aabg-038(1)}

Structural Isomerism : Compounds which possess the same molecular formula but differ in bonding arrangement of atoms (or) groups within the molecule i.e. differ in structure [A structural formula for a compound conveys which atom is directly linked to which other atom. It, however, tells nothing about the shape of the molecule but indicates the groups of elements present which provide clues to the properties of the substance], are structural isomers and this phenomenon is known as structural isomerism.\\
(A) Chain or Nuclear Isomerism: In this type the isomers differ in the variation of the carbon chain (or skeleton) of the molecule. The same molecular formula may represent a straight chain of carbons as well as a branched chain. The molecular formula $\mathrm{C}_{4} \mathrm{H}_{10}$ stands for two isomers namely $n$-butane and isobutane.\\
\includegraphics[max width=\textwidth, center]{2025_01_28_8470952b98110cec3aabg-039(11)}\\

(B) Position Isomerism : Position isomerism is shown by the compounds in which there is difference in the position of attachment of the functional group, multiple bond or substituent along the same chain length of carbon atoms -\\
Ex. (i) Molecular formula : $\mathrm{C}_{3} \mathrm{H}_{7} \mathrm{X}\left(\mathrm{X}=\right.$ halogen, $\mathrm{NH}_{2}, \mathrm{OH}$, or OR$)$\\

In the disubstituted benzene derivatives, position isomerism also exists because of the relative position occupied by the substituents on the benzene ring. Thus, chlorotoluene, $\mathrm{C}_{6} \mathrm{H}_{4}\left(\mathrm{CH}_{3}\right) \mathrm{Cl}$ exists in three isomeric forms - ortho, meta and para.\\

(E) Tautomerism : It is a special type of functional isomerism in which the isomers are readily interchangeable and maintain a dynamic equilibrium with each other. Hence, the name dynamic isomerism. Both the isomers represent one and a single substance. Reversibility of change is due to mobility of a group oratom which can move from one position to another in the molecule, often with rearrangement of a double bond. These two forms are called tautomers and tautomerides of each other.\\
Cause of tautomerism : Migration of acidic hydrogen from $\alpha$-carbon to electronegative atom which is bonded with multiple bond is the cause of tautomerism.\\
\includegraphics[max width=\textwidth, center]{2025_01_28_8470952b98110cec3aabg-041(1)}\\
(i) Both, (I) and (II) are isomers, known as tautomers.\\
(ii) Tautomers are always in equilibrium state.\\
(iii) Number of sigma, pi and lone pair of electrons in both tautomers are always same.\\
(iv) Tautomerism is a chemical phenomenon which takes place only in liquid state.\\
(v) Tautomerism is catalysed by acid as well as base.\\
(vi) Tautomers are always reversible functional isomers.

\section*{Tautomerism is of several types; the two important types are dyad and triad systems}
(a) Dyad system: It involves the oscillation of H atoms between two polyvalent atoms present as 1 and 2, e.g., hydrogen cyanide (I) and hydrogen isocyanide (II).

$$
\mathrm{H}-\mathrm{C} \equiv \mathrm{~N} \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{H}-\mathrm{N} \equiv \mathrm{C}
$$

(I)\\
(II)

In the above example the H atom vibrates between carbon and nitrogen atoms. The alkyl derivatives of $(\mathrm{I})$ are called cyanides while those of (II) isocyanides.\\
(b) Triad system: In it one H atom oscillates between two polyvalent atoms present as 1 and 3 .

Keto-Enol Tautomerism : When the tautomers exist in the two forms keto \& enol then, such type of tautomerism is called keto-enol tautomerism'. It was discovered by 'Knorr' in 1911 in acetoacetic ester. The keto form means the compound has a keto group $>\mathrm{C}=\mathrm{O}$, and the enol form has both double bond and OH (hydroxy) group joined to the same carbon.\\

For a keto compound to be converted to enol form it must have an $\alpha$-hydrogen (i.e., hydrogen attached to the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group). Thus benzaldehyde, $m$-chlorobenzaldehyde (in general, aromatic aldehydes), formaldehyde, trimethylacetaldehyde donot exist as their enol forms.\\

\section*{Structural requirement for tautomerism :}
(i) Compound should have electronegative atom bonded with multiple bond (i.e. N and O ).\\
(ii) Compound should have at least one acidic hydrogen present on $\alpha$-carbon of the molecule. If the compound fulfills these two conditions, it will show tautomerism. For example,\\
\includegraphics[max width=\textwidth, center]{2025_01_28_8470952b98110cec3aabg-042(1)}

These compounds fulfill both the conditions, hence these will show tautomerism.\\
\includegraphics{smile-0011d58c4450ec958d84dedff3a03715c15ed447}\\
\includegraphics{smile-7d6ffbbf24527a1e2a8beb5ce131d2b0815261d3}\\
\includegraphics{smile-278b6b873ab02e41ec314c52b78923b128bd36fb}

In these compounds electronegative atom is bonded with multiple bond but compound has no hydrogen on $\alpha$-carbon hence these compounds will not show tautomerism.\\
If a compound has active methylene group or active methyne group it is the H atom of the methylene (or methyne) group that migrates in keto form to give corresponding enol. For example\\
\includegraphics[max width=\textwidth, center]{2025_01_28_8470952b98110cec3aabg-043}\\
\includegraphics{smile-e9a58e082bdefb223f4ab64c9ff724d8f271f51b}\\

\includegraphics{smile-ee6ac695e152521bfc8ec85448f0c59f5b2a9a93}

These compounds will also show tautomerism because these compounds fulfill both structural requirements.\\
Enolisation : The conversion of a keto form into an enol form is known as enolisation and the enolisation of a compound has been found to depend upon various factors such as structural factor, temperature and nature of solvent. However, the most important is the structural factor like resonance and hydrogen bonding.\\
Quantity of enol $\mu$ no. of -CO groups $\mu$ no. of a-H\\

(a) Ketonic form predominates in simple monocarbonyl compounds like acetaldehyde, acetone and cyclohexanone. This is due to the greater bond strength of $\mathrm{C}=\mathrm{O} \mid>\mathrm{C}=0,365 \mathrm{~kJ} / \mathrm{mole}$ ) present in keto form than the carbon-carbon double bond ( $\mathrm{C}=\mathrm{C}, 250 \mathrm{~kJ} /$ mole) present in enolic form.\\
(b) Enolic form predominates in 1,3-diketones due to intramolecular hydrogen bonding and resonance. Intramolecular hydrogen bonding stabilizes enol form by $7 \mathrm{kcal} / \mathrm{mole}$ and resonance stabilizes enol form by $15 \mathrm{kcal} / \mathrm{mole}$. Thus enol form is more stable than keto form by $22 \mathrm{kcal} /$ mole in 1,3 -diketones.

Mechanism of tautomerism : Acid catalysed tautomerism is a two step process.\\
(i) Proton transfer from the acid catalyst, H-A, to the carbonyl oxygen forms the conjugate acid of the aldehyde (or) ketone.\\

(conjugate acid of ketone)\\
(ii) Proton transfer from the $\alpha$-carbon of the conjugate acid to the base $A^{\ominus}$ gives enol and generates the acid catalyst, H-A.\\
\includegraphics[max width=\textwidth, center]{2025_01_28_8470952b98110cec3aabg-044(2)}

With unsymmetrical ketones, enolization may occur in either of two directions.\\
\includegraphics[max width=\textwidth, center]{2025_01_28_8470952b98110cec3aabg-044(1)}

Here ketone is by far the most abundant species present at equilibrium. Both enols are also present, but in very small concentrations. The enol with the more highly substituted double bond is more stable hence it is present in higher concentration than the other.\\

\section*{STEREOISOMERISM:}
Two or more compounds which have same molecular formula and same connectivity of atoms but different three dimensional arrangement of their constituent atom or groups are said to be stereoisomers and the phenomenon is termed as stereoisomerism.\\
The branch of chemistry which deals with the study of molecular structures in three dimensional space is called stereochemistry.\\
Thus stereoisomers have : (a) same molecular formula, (b) same molecular weight, (c) same structure but (d) different properties and orientation of atom or groups in space.\\
It is of two types: (i) Geometrical and (ii) Optical.\\
Stereoisomers can also be classified as (a) conformational isomers that include rotation about single bonds and amine inversion.\\
(b) configurational isomers that include cis-trans isomers and (c) isomers that contain chirality centers.

Conformational isomers can interconvert rapidly at room temperature. Because they interconvert, conformational isomers cannot be separated. Conformational isomers are also called conformers.\\
Configurational isomers cannot interconvert (unless a covalent bond breaks, which can happen only under vigorous conditions. Because configurational isomers cannot interconvert, they can be separated.

\section*{GEOMETRICALISOMERISM:}
Geometrical isomers possess the same structural formula containing a double bond and differ only in respect of the arrangement of atoms or groups about the double bond. It is shown by alkenes or their derivatives in which two different atoms or groups are attached to each carbon containing the double bond. Double bond creates restricted rotation.

Ex. $>\mathrm{C}=\mathrm{C}<,>\mathrm{C}=\mathrm{N}-,-\mathrm{N}=\mathrm{N}-, \quad \mathrm{N}=\mathrm{N}$ or\\
\includegraphics{smile-2e2776ef358191343ff4a10d7588825a19cdbf29}

The compound having the formula $a b C=C a b$ occurs in two forms and exhibits geometrical isomerism.\\
\includegraphics[max width=\textwidth, center]{2025_01_28_8470952b98110cec3aabg-045}\\

(Same groups lie on same side) (Same groups lie on opposite side)\\
\includegraphics{smile-acc1d4e37e6354bb3cb5b906ad9e0524410ee1a5}\\
(trans form)

If the two atoms or groups linked to a doubly bonded carbon atom are similar as in the molecule $\mathrm{aaC}=\mathrm{Cab}$, the compound does not show geometrical isomerism. Here the two possible configurations are, in fact the same.\\

\includegraphics{smile-b21543032adb3b50d59c2accebe8ab5feb7ee90b}\\
(II)

Cyclic compounds can alsohave cis and trans isomers because the cyclic system prevents free rotation about the single bonds.

(ii) E-Z system of designating configuration : Cis and trans designations for geometrical isomers are suitable when structurally similar or identical groups are joined to both of the doubly bonded carbon atoms.\\
cis-trans Method does not work when there are no similar groups.\\
$\mathrm{Ex} .[\mathrm{BrClC}=\mathrm{CF}]$\\
In such cases, configuration can be specified by using the notations Z and E .\\
The method of E, Z-system :\\
Find out the groups of highest priority on each carbon :-\\
If two high priority groups are on the same side the configuration is Z , (zusammen-German word for together).\\
If the two groups of high priority are on apposite sides, the configuration is E (entgegen-opposite).\\
(a) Naming of compound is based on priority order (atomic number of the atoms bounded directly to a particular $s p^{2}$ carbon)\\
atomic number $\uparrow \Rightarrow$ priority $\uparrow$\\
atomic number $\downarrow \Rightarrow$ priority $\downarrow$\\
Ex. $\mathrm{I}>\mathrm{Br}>\mathrm{Cl}>\mathrm{O}>\mathrm{C}>\mathrm{H}$\\
(b) In the case of a tie in the atomic numbers, the atoms that are attached to the "tied" atoms must be considered. If an atom is doubly bonded to another atom, the priority system treats it as if it were bonded to two of those atoms. In the case of isotopes (atoms with the same atomic number but different mass numbers), the mass number is used to determine their relative priorities. Deuterium and hydrogen have the same atomic number, but deuterium has a greater mass number, so it has the higher priority.

Properties related to geometrical isomers.\\
(i) Geometrical isomerism arises due to restricted rotation about a double bond\\
(ii) Stability: trans $>$ cis

The trans isomers of alkenes are more stable than their corresponding cis isomer. In the cis isomer, the two bulkyl groups remain very close to each other. The repulsion is more pronounced hence less stable. In trans isomer, the bulky groups lie on opposite sides, i.e., far apart hence less repulsion and more stable.

Ex.\\

(b) Polarity: $\quad$ cis $>$ trans ; $\mu \propto$ polarity\\
(c) Solubility : cis $>$ trans; Polar nature $\uparrow$, solubility $\uparrow$\\
(d) Boiling point : cis $>$ trans\\
(e) Melting point : trans $>$ cis

Melting point does not depend on polarity but depends on packing capacity of molecule.\\
Packing capacity $\uparrow$, Melting point $\uparrow$\\
(f) Separation : cis and trans isomers can be separated by fractional distillation or fractional crystallisation.\\
(g) cis and trans forms can be interchanged :

The interconversion cis $\rightarrow$ trans or trans $\rightarrow$ cis is possible.\\
On heating $\pi$-bond is broken and reforms on cooling.\\
Ex. Maleic acid (cis) $\xrightarrow[-\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}]{373 \mathrm{~K}}$ Maleic anhydride\\
Fumaric acid (trans) $\xrightarrow{513 \mathrm{~K}}$ Maleic acid $\xrightarrow{-\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}}$ Maleic anhydride\\
Anhydride formation in maleic acid is easier than in fumaric acid\\
The number of geometrical isomers for alkenes :\\
(a) If alkene has one double bond, then number of geometrical isomers is two.

Ex. 2-Butene\\

cis\\
\includegraphics{smile-31adeffcfb34b6a8e33f7b13099c861f6cf00ba0}\\
trans\\
(b) If alkene has two or more double bonds.\\
(i) In structure, if the terminal groups are non-similar. Then we can use formula.

Number of isomers $=2^{n} \quad$ [Where $n=$ No. of double bonds ( $n=$ odd/even)]\\
Ex. $\mathrm{CH}_{3}-\mathrm{CH}=\mathrm{CH}-\mathrm{CH}=\mathrm{CH}-\mathrm{CH}=\mathrm{CH}-\mathrm{Br}$\\
No. of isomers $=2^{3}=8$\\
(ii) In structure, if the terminal groups are similar. Then we can use formula.

Then number of isomers $=2^{n-1}+2^{p-1} \quad(n=$ No. of double bonds $)$\\
$p=n / 2 \Rightarrow$ when $n$ is even number\\
$p=\frac{n+1}{2} \Rightarrow$ when $n$ is odd number\\
Ex. (i) $\mathrm{H}_{3} \mathrm{C}-\mathrm{CH}=\mathrm{CH}-\mathrm{CH}=\mathrm{CH}-\mathrm{CH}=\mathrm{CH}-\mathrm{CH}_{3}$\\
2,4,6-Octatriene\\
$n=3, \quad p=\frac{3+1}{2} ;$ Number of isomers $=2^{2}+2^{1}=4+2=6$\\
(ii)\\
\includegraphics[max width=\textwidth, center]{2025_01_28_8470952b98110cec3aabg-048}\\
$n=4, p=2$\\

\section*{OPTICAL ISOMERISM:}
(i) The geometrical isomers differ in physical properties such as melting point, boiling point, density etc. and also in certain chemical properties.\\
(ii) The optical isomers will have the same chemical reactions and will be alike in all physical properties mentioned above.\\
(iii) They can only be distinguished by their action on plane polarized light, this property is often referred as the optical property.

\section*{Optical activity:}
(i) Plane polarised light can be obtained by passing ordinary light through Nicol prism.\\

\includegraphics[max width=\textwidth, center]{2025_01_28_8470952b98110cec3aabg-048(2)}

Plane rotated to the right\\
(ii) When certain organic compounds in their solutions are placed in the path of a plane polarized light, they have the remarkable property of rotating its plane through a certain angle which may be either to the left or to the right if the polarized light has its vibrations in the plane $A B$ before entering such a solution, the direction on leaving it will be changed to say $A^{\prime} B^{\prime}$, the plane have been rotated through the angle as in a (fig.).\\
(iii) This property of a substance of rotating the plane polarized light is called optical activity and the substance possessing it is said to be optically active.\\
\includegraphics[max width=\textwidth, center]{2025_01_28_8470952b98110cec3aabg-048(8)}\\
(A) The observed rotation of the plane polarised light produced by a solution depends on.\\
(i) Nature of the substance\\
(ii) Solvent used\\
(iii) Concentration of solution\\
(iv) Length of polarimeter tube\\
(v) Temperature of the experiment\\
(vi) Wavelength of the incident light used.\\
(B) For the measurement of optical rotation, the term specific rotation is introduced.\\
(i) Specific rotation is a physical constant characteristic of a substance as much as the melting point, boiling point, density or its refractive index.\\
(ii) It is defined as the number of degrees of rotation observed when light is passed through 1 decimeter of its solution having concentration of 1 gram per milliliter.\\
(iii) The specific rotation of a given substance can be calculated by using the following expression.

$$
[\alpha]=\frac{\alpha_{\mathrm{tovs}}}{\ell \times c}
$$

where $[\alpha]=$ specific rotation determined at $l^{\circ} \mathrm{C}, \alpha_{\text {obs }}-$ the observed angle of rotation, $\ell=$ length of the polarimeter tube $c=$ concentration of the active compound in $\mathrm{gm} / \mathrm{ml}$.\\
The sign attached with the angle of rotation signifies the direction of rotation. Negative sign(-) indicates that the rotation is toward the left, while positive $(+)$ sign means that the direction of rotation is towards right.\\
The simple organic compounds which show optical activity are :

Lactic acid

$$
\mathrm{CH}_{3}-\stackrel{\ominus}{\mathrm{C}} \mathrm{H}(\mathrm{OH})-\mathrm{COOH}
$$

\includegraphics[max width=\textwidth, center]{2025_01_28_8470952b98110cec3aabg-049}\\
\includegraphics[max width=\textwidth, center]{2025_01_28_8470952b98110cec3aabg-049(1)}

All these substances are known to exist optically active in two forms.\\
(1) One rotating the plane of polarised light to the left. This form is named as laevorotatory\\
(Latin, laevous = left direction) or $(-)-$ form\\
(2) One rotating the plane of polarized light exactly to the same extent but to the right, this form is named dextrorotatory (Latin Dexter - right direction or ( + )-form.\\
(3) An inactive form which does not rotate the plane polarized light at all. This is mixture of equal amounts of $(+)$-and $(-)$-forms and hence it is optically inactive. It is named $( \pm)$-mixture or racemic mixture.\\
(Latin, Racemic - mixture of equal compounds)\\
Note: Three lactic acids are known; they are: (a) ( + )-lactic acid, (b) ( - ) - lactic acid and (c) ( $\pm$ ) mixture since the ( $\pm$ ) acid is only a mixture of $(+)$-and $(-)$ forms, in reality lactic acid exists in two forms. These two acids are exactly identical in physical and chemical properties but differ in their action on the plane polarized light as they have different sign of specific rotation.

\section*{CHIRAIITY CENTER (Stereogenic centre, stereocentre or assymetric carbon)}
A carbon bonded to four different groups is called a chirality center. The chirality center in each of the following compounds is indicated by an asterisk. For example, the fourth carbon in 4 -octanol is a chirality center because it is bonded to four different groups ( $\mathrm{H}, \mathrm{OH}, \mathrm{CH}_{2} \mathrm{CH}_{2} \mathrm{CH}_{3}$, and $\mathrm{CH}_{2} \mathrm{CH}_{2} \mathrm{CH}_{2} \mathrm{CH}_{3}$ ). Notice that the difference in the groups bonded to the chirality center is not necessarily right next to the chirality center the propyl and butyl groups are different groups. The starred carbon in\\
2,4-dimethylhexane is a chirality center because it is bonded to four different groups - methyl, ethyl, isobutyl, and hydrogen.\\
\includegraphics[max width=\textwidth, center]{2025_01_28_8470952b98110cec3aabg-049(2)}

Notice that the only carbons that can be chirality centers are $s p^{3}$ hybridized carbons, $s p^{2}$ and $s p$ hyrbidized carbons cannot be chirality centers because they cannot have four groups attached to them.\\
All organic compounds containing an asymmetric carbon atom (lactic acid, amyl alcohol etc.) are optically active.\\

Sol. A stereogenic carbon has four different substituents. (a) In 2-bromopentane, C-2 satisfies this requirement. (b) None of the carbons in 3-bromopentane has four different substitutents, and so none of its carbon atom has stereogenic center\\

Elements of symmetry : A molecule as a whole is asymmetric if it does not possess any element of symmetry such as\\
(i) Plane of symmetry (ii) Centre of symmetry\\
(i) Plane of symmetry or mirror plane: An imaginary plane which bisects a molecule in such a way that one half of the molecule is exactly the mirror image of the other half.\\
\includegraphics[max width=\textwidth, center]{2025_01_28_8470952b98110cec3aabg-050}\\
...D...\\
(ii) Centre of symmetry : An imaginary point in a molecule which divides the structure of a molecule into two exactly identical parts.\\
\includegraphics[max width=\textwidth, center]{2025_01_28_8470952b98110cec3aabg-050(1)}

Symmetrical molecule is always optically inactive.\\
Chirality: This term has been recently used to describe such molecules which have no element of symmetry, thus asymmetric molecules are also called chiral molecules and optical activity is attributed to certain chiral centres in them. An asymmetric carbon is a chiral centre. An asymmetric object cannot be superimposed on its mirror image. Chirality is lost when the two atoms bonded to an asymmetric carbon become similar thus while lactic acid is optically active, propionic acid is not.\\
Chirality or molecular dissymmetry is cause of optical isomerism :\\
(i) The necessary condition for a molecule to exhibit optical isomerism is dissymmetry or chirality.\\
(ii) Thus organic compounds which contain asymmetric carbon ( $\mathrm{C}^{*}$ abde) are chiral and exist in two tetrahedral forms.\\
(iii) Although the two forms (I and II) have the same structure, they have different arrangements of groups a, b, d, and e about the asymmetric carbon. In fact, they represent asymmetric molecules because they do not have a plane of symmetry, they are related to each other as an object to its mirror image and are non superimposable.\\
(iv) The two models or structures (I and II) actually stand for dextro or $(+)$ and laevo or $(-)$ isomers. Since they are related to each other as mirror images, they are commonly called enantiomorphs (Greek word, enantio =opposite, morph form) or enantiomers. Thus optical isomerism is often referred to as an enantiomerism.\\
(v) Optical isomers or enantiomers due to the presence of an asymmetric carbon atom in a compound differ only in the arrangement or configuration of groups of tetrahedral perspective.\\
(vi) Examples of compounds which exist as ( + ) and ( - ) enantiomers.

\section*{Criterion of enantiomerism :}
(i) The compound which contains one or more asymmetric carbon atoms shows enantiomerism.\\
(ii) But, there ave some known compounds which have asymmetric carbon but due to presence of plane of symmetry, they do not show enantiomerism.\\
(iii) meso -Tartaric acid has two asymmetric carbons but is optically inactive.\\

Drawing of enantiomers : Once you have determined that a compound has a chirality center, there are several ways to draw the enantiomers. Perspective formulas show two of the bonds to the chirality center in the plane of the paper, one bond as a solid wedge coming out of the paper, and the fourth bond as a dashed line projecting back from the paper. You can draw the first enantiomer by putting the four groups on the four bonds to the chirality center in any order. Draw the second enantiomer by making a mirror image of the first enantiomer.\\
\includegraphics{smile-9ceb0671aae8a0d7175850ba4cb5108316a465c9}\\
\includegraphics{smile-c1987700d5ec476d44c7b40a1c6d1088abe3de8d}

Perspective formulas of the enantiomers of 2-bromobutane\\
You can also draw enantiomers using wedge-and-dash structures. Draw the first enantiomer by arranging the four groups bonded to the chirality center in any order. Draw the second enantiomer by interchanging two of the groups. It does not make any difference which two groups you interchange. (It is a good idea to make models to convince yourself that this is true.) Many organic chemists prefer to interchange the horizontal groups, because the two enantiomers then look like mirror images on paper.\\

Wedge-and-dash representations of the enantiomers of 2-bromobutane

A shortcut for showing the three-dimensional arrangement of groups bonded to a chirality center was devised in the late 1800s by Emil Fischer. Fischer used a single dot to represent a bond that was slanted away from the viewer and a solid line for a bond that was directed toward the viewer. Several years later, Victor-Meyer modified Fischer's method. He used the point of intersection of two perpendicular lines to represent the chirality center; horizontal lines represent the bonds that project out of the plane of the paper toward the viewer, and vertical lines represent the bonds that project back from the plane of the paper away from the viewer. This method of representing the arrangement of groups bonded to a chirality center is known as a Fischer projection formula or, more simply, a Fischer projection.\\
\includegraphics[max width=\textwidth, center]{2025_01_28_8470952b98110cec3aabg-052}

DL Configuration: In this system the standard chosen for assigning relative configurations was glyceraldehyde. The absolute configurations of $(+)$ and $(-)$ glyceraldehyde are as.\\

L-Glyceraldehyde\\

The other stereoisomers can be assigned $D$ or $L$ notation by comparison with the structural arrangements of $D$ - and $L$ glyceraldehyde. For the purpose of comparison the following steps may be followed.\\
(i) The most oxidised carbon attached to the chiral center is placed on the top of vertical line\\

Now comparison can be made with the configurations of glyceraldehyde. For example, the two enantiomeric forms of lactic acid can be compared as follow :

(b) $\mathrm{D} \& \mathrm{~L}$-notations are applicable only for those stereoisomers which can be converted to or prepared from D \& L glyceraldehyde.

\section*{R,S Configuration (absolute configuration)}
(a) This is a newer and more systematic method of specifying absolute configuration to optically active compounds. This totally depends on sequence rule or CIP-system (sequence rule proposed by R.S. Cahn, C.K. Ingold and V.Prelog)\\
(b) This system of designating configuration has been used increasingly since the early 1960 and may eventually replace the DL-system.\\
(c) In this system, the configuration of a stereiosomer is designated by using prefix R derived from Greek word rectus (means-right) and S derived from Greek word sinister (means-left). The procedure involves two main steps as described below.\\
Step 1. Rank the groups (or atoms) which are bonded to the chirality centre in order of priority. The criterion of priority is based on certain set of rules known as sequence rules or Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority rules given as under.\\
The sequence rules or CIP-priority rule:\\
(i) The atoms or groups directly bonded to the asymmetric carbon are arranged in order of decreasing atomic number and assigned priority $1,2,3,4$, accordingly.\\
Thus in chlorobromofluoromethane $(\mathrm{CHClBrF})$, the substituent $\mathrm{Br}($ at no. $=35), \mathrm{Cl}($ at no $=17), \mathrm{F}($ at no $=9)$ and H (at no $=1$ ) are given following order of priorities.\\
Br\\
$(1)$\\
(2)\\
(3)\\
H\\
(4)\\
(ii) When two or more groups have identical first atoms attached to asymmetric carbon, the priority order is determined by considering the atomic numbers of the second atoms; and if the second atoms are also identical the third atoms along the chain are examined.\\
Let us consider the three groups

In methyl and ethyl, the first atom is carbon and therefore, atomic numbers of the second atoms H (at no 1 ) and C (at no 6) decide the priority order, ethyl > methyl. While considering ethyl and $n$-propyl the second atom is also identical (carbon) and hence the third atoms $(\mathrm{H}, \mathrm{C})$ give the priority order $n$-propyl > ethyl.\\
(iii) If the first atoms of the two groups have same substituents of higher atomic number, the one with more substituents takes priority. Thus $-\mathrm{CHCl}_{2}$ has a higher priority than $-\mathrm{CH}_{2} \mathrm{Cl}$\\
(iv) Adoubly or triply bonded atom ' A ' present in a group appended to asymmetric carbon, is considered equivalent to two or three singly bonded ' $A$ ' s , respectively.\\
\includegraphics[max width=\textwidth, center]{2025_01_28_8470952b98110cec3aabg-053(1)}

Hence of the two groups, viz. $-\mathrm{C}=0(0,0, \mathrm{H})$ and $-\mathrm{CH}_{2} \mathrm{OH}(\mathrm{O}, \mathrm{H}, \mathrm{H})$, the former will have higher priority. Aphenyl group is handled as if it had one of the Kekule structures.\\
\includegraphics[max width=\textwidth, center]{2025_01_28_8470952b98110cec3aabg-053}

It may be noted that the R and S system is merely a nomenclature device and has nothing to do with the sign and magnitude of optical activity. Thus the complete description of an optically active compound must include both the direction of rotation\\
( + or - ) and the configuration of the compound ( R or S ). A racemic modification is an equimolecular mixture of two enantiomers and is given the prefix (RS).\\
Step 2. After deciding the priorities of atoms or groups around the chirality centre, the molecule is visualised in such a way that atom or group with lowest priority is directed away from the eye. Now, observe the remaining atoms or groups in decreasing order of priorities, i.e., from 1 to 2 to 3 . In doing so, if movement of eye occurs in clockwise direction the configuration is specified as R . On the other hand, if eye moves in anticlockwise direction, the configuration is specified as $S$.\\
If you forget which is which, you can imagine driving a car and turning the steering wheel to make a right or left turn.\\
Let us now use steps 1 and step 2 to specify the configurations of enantiomers of (i) 2-butanol and (ii) lactic acid.\\
(i) 2-Butanol $\left(\mathrm{CH}_{3}-\mathrm{C} \mathrm{C}-\mathrm{C}_{2} \mathrm{H}_{5}\right)$. The sequence of priority of groups around the chirality centre is $\mathrm{OH}(1), \mathrm{C}_{2} \mathrm{H}_{5}(2)$, OH\\
$\mathrm{CH}_{3}(3), \mathrm{H}(4)$. Visualising the enantiomeric forms with H directed away from the eye.\\

\section*{R and S Notations for the optical isomers represented by fischer projections (by planar formulae).}
\section*{Case 1: When the atom or group of lowest priority is at the bottom:}
Simply rotate the eye in decreasing order of priority and find the configuration of chiral carbon. For example,\\

While comparing two Fischer projections to ares if they are the same or different, never rotate one $90^{\circ}$ or turn one over, because this is a quick way to get a wrong answer. A Fischer projection can be rotated $180^{\circ}$ in the plane of the paper, but this is the only way to move it without risking an incorrect answer.

\section*{(Exatione 8 :}
Do the following structures represent identical molecules or a pair of enantiomers?\\
\includegraphics[max width=\textwidth, center]{2025_01_28_8470952b98110cec3aabg-055}

Sol. The easiest way to det mine whether the two structures represent identical molecules or a pair of enantiomers is to determine their configurations. If they have the same configuration, they are identical, if they have opposite configurations, they are enantiomers. The first structure shown above has the $S$ configuration and the second structure has the R configuration. Therefore, the above two structures represent a pair of enantiomers.\\
Optical Isomerism In compounds with more than one Asymmetric carbon Atom :\\
(i) An asymmetric carbon can produce molecular asymmetry.\\
(ii) Thus the molecules containing an asymmetric carbon exist in two optically active forms, $(+)$ - isomer and $(-)$-isomer, and an equimolar mixture of the two, $( \pm)$ - mixture, which is optically inactive.\\
(iii) When there are two or more asymmetric carbon atoms in a molecule, the problem is complicated considerably.\\
(iv) An organic compound which contains two dissimilar asymmetric carbons, can give four possible stereoisomeric form. Thus 2 -bromo-3-chlorobutane may be written as\\
\includegraphics{smile-3fff19ec5b142da00a1291da9b4f39769e8c1283}\\
(v) The two asymmetric carbons in the above molecule are dissimilar in the sense that the groups attached to each of these are different.\\
$\mathrm{C}_{2}$ has $\mathrm{CH}_{3}, \mathrm{H}, \mathrm{Br}, \mathrm{CHClCH}_{3}$ $\mathrm{C}_{3}$ has $\mathrm{CH}_{3}, \mathrm{H}, \mathrm{Cl}, \mathrm{CHBrCH}_{3}$\\
Such a substance can be represented in four configurational forms.\\
\includegraphics{smile-10d5b757ce737db9b89eb6bee88e0f4c89e4d7a4}\\

(III)\\
\includegraphics{smile-6630f454a52c53a396d3c8c306e0a31cbfefc2bc}\\
(IV)\\
(vi) The forms I and II are optical enantiomers (related as object and mirror image) and so are forms III and IV. These two pairs of enantiomers will give rise to two possible racemic modifications.\\
(vii) It may be noted that forms I $(2 S, 3 S)$ and $I I(2 S, 3 R)$ are not mirror images or enantiomers, and yet they are optically active isomers. Similarly, the other two forms i.e., II $(2 R, 3 R)$ and IV $(2 R, 3 S)$ are also not enantiomers but optically active isomers.\\
(viii) Such stereoisomers which are optically active isomers but not mirror images, are called diastereoismers or diastereomers.\\
(ix) Diastereoisomers have different physical properties. Thus they have different melting points, solubilities in a given solvent, densities, and refractive indices. They also differ in specific rotations ; they may have the same or opposite signs of rotations.

Like geometrical isomers, the diastereoisomers may be separated from each other\\
(i) by fractional distillation due to their difference in boiling points.\\
(ii) by fractional crystallisation due to their difference in solubility.\\
(iii) by chromatography due to their different molecular shapes and polarity.

\section*{OPTICAL PURITY:}
Whether a particular compound consists of a single enantiomer or a mixture of enantiomers can be determined by its observed specific rotation. For example, an enantiomerically pure sample of (S)-( + )-2-bromobutane will have an observed specific rotation of $+23.1^{\circ}$ because the specific rotation of $(\mathrm{S})-(+)-2$-bromobutane is $+23.1^{\circ}$. If, however, the sample of 2 -bromobutane has an observed specific rotation of $0^{\circ}$, we can say that the compound is a racemic mixture. If the observed specific rotation is positive but less than $+23.1^{\circ}$, we can conclude that the sample is a mixture of enantiomers and the mixture contains more of the enantiomer with the S configuration than the enantiomer with the R configuration.\\
From the observed specific rotation, we can calculate the amount of each enantiomer present in the mixture. First we must calculate the optical purity using the following formula.

$$
\text { Optical Purity }=\frac{\text { Observed specific rotation }}{\text { Specific rotation of the pure enantiomer }}
$$

For example, if a sample of 2-bromobutane has an observed specific rotation of $+9.2^{\circ}$, its optical purity is 0.40 . In other words, it is $40 \%$ optically pure.

$$
\text { Optical Purity }==\frac{+9.2^{\circ}}{+23.1^{\circ}}=0.40 \text { or } 40 \%
$$

Because the observed specific rotation is positive, it is certain that the solution contains ( S )-( + )-2-bromobutane. The optical purity tells us how much excess $(\mathrm{S})-(+)$-2-bromobutane is in the mixture. The mixture is $40 \%$ optically pure, which means that the solution has $60 \%$ recemic mixture ( $30 \% \mathrm{~S}+30 \% \mathrm{R}$ ) and $40 \% \mathrm{~S}$ enantiomer. In other words, solution has $70 \%(40+30) S$ enantiomer and $30 \% \mathrm{R}$.

\section*{Number of optical isomers :}
Case : 1. When the molecule is unsymmetrical. (It cannot be divided into two halves)\\
Number of d and $\ell$ isomers $(a)=2^{n}$, Number of meso form $(m)=0$\\
Total number of optical isomers $(a+m)=2^{n}$; where $n$ is the number of chiral carbon atoms.\\
Ex. 2,3-Pentanediol :\\
\includegraphics{smile-910c3363bb6ba7ea53bb16c8fffa4a95147991a0}\\
$d$ and $\ell$ isomers $=2^{2}=4$; meso form $=0$\\
Case : 2 When the molecule is symmetrical. (number of chiral carbon $n=$ even number)\\
Number of $d$ and $\ell$ forms $(a)=2^{(n-1)}$, Number of meso form $(m)=2^{(n / 2)-1}$, Total number $=(a+m)$\\
Ex. Tartaric acid\\
\includegraphics{smile-f4d36c31905f22fc07f1da103e1e14076aed5281}

Number of $d$ and $l$ forms $=2^{(2-1)}=2$, Number of meso form $=2^{(2 / 2)-1}=2^{0}=1$, Total optical isomers $=3$\\
Case : 3 . When the molecule is symmetrical. (Number of chiral carbon, $n=$ odd number)\\
Number of $d$ and $\ell$ forms $(a)=2^{(n-1)}-2^{(n / 2)^{-1 / 2}}$\\
Number of meso form $(m)=2^{\left(n / 2^{-1 / 2}\right)}$\\
Total number of isomers $=(a+m)=2^{n-1}$

Ex. $\mathrm{HOOC}-\mathrm{CH}\left(\mathrm{CH}_{3}\right)-\mathrm{CHOH}-\mathrm{CHBr}-\mathrm{CHOH}-\mathrm{CH}\left(\mathrm{CH}_{3}\right)-\mathrm{COOH}$. Here $n=5$\\
Number of $d$ and $f$ forms $=2^{4}-2^{2}=12$\\
Number of meso forms $=2^{2}=4$\\
Total optical isomers $=12+4=16$\\
Isomerism in tartaric acid : Let us consider the optical isomerism in tartaric acid which contains two similar asymmetric carbon atoms, in detail. The two asymmetric carbon atoms in tartaric acid,

\begin{verbatim}
* CH(OH)COOH
I
*CH(OH)COOH
\end{verbatim}

are attached to the groups $\mathrm{H}, \mathrm{OH}, \mathrm{COOH}$ and $\mathrm{CH}(\mathrm{OH}) \mathrm{COOH}$. Its molecule can be represented by space models of two tetrahedra joined at corner but for the sake of convenience we will use the planar formulas. The end groups being identical, in all four arrangements are possible depending on whether one or both H and OH groups are on the left or on the right.\\

Of these, formula IV when rotated through $180^{\circ}$ in the plane of the paper becomes identical with formula III. Therefore, for tartaric acid we can have only three different arrangements.\\

(i) structure I will rotate the plane of polarised light to the right and will represent ( + ) - tartaric acid.\\
(ii) structure II will rotate the plane of polarised light to the left and will represent $(-)$-tartaric acid, and\\
(iii) structure III will represent optically inactive tartaric acid, since the rotatory power of the upper half of the molecule is balanced by that of the lower half.\\
It may also be noted that formulas I and II are mirror images of each other and hence represent ( + )-and ( - )-isomers 'Formula III, however, has a plane of symmetry (dotted line) and hence represent an inactive isomer of tartaric acid.\\
In actual practice, four tartaric acids are known :\\
(i) $(+)$ - Tartaric acid ;\\
(ii) (-)- Tartaric acid ;\\
(iii) Inactive tartaric acid ; this is also known as meso - tartaric acid or m-tartaric acid ; and\\
(iv) $( \pm)$ - Tartaric acid ; this form of tartaric acid is a mixture of equal amounts of $(+)$ - and $(-)$ isomers.

This is optically inactive due to internal compensation.\\
The three tartaric acids, $(+),(-)$-, and $m$-, are all space isomers but $m$-tartaric acid is not a mirror image of either of the active forms. Hence it differs from them in melting point, density and other physical properties. External compensation :\\
(i) If equimolecular amounts of d-and $\ell$-isomers are mixed in a solvent, the solution is inactive.\\
(ii) The rotation of each isomer is balanced or compensated by the equal but opposite rotation of the other.\\
(iii) Optical inactivity having this origin is described as due to external compensation. Such mixtures of ( + ) - and ( - )isomers (racemic mixture) can be separated into the active components.\\
Internal compensation :\\
(iv) In meso tartaric acid the inactivity is due to effects within the molecule and not external. The force of rotation due to one half of the molecule is balanced by the opposite and equal force due to the other half.\\
(v) The optical inactivity so produced is said to be due to internal compensation.\\
(vi) It occurs whenever a compound containing two or more asymmetric carbon atoms has plane or point of symmetry.\\
(vii) Since the optical inactivity of such a compound arises within the molecule, the question of separating into active components does not arise.\\

\section*{CONFORMATION:}
(i) Molecules which differ from one another due to rotation about single-single bond.\\
(ii) It one $\mathrm{CH}_{3}$ group of ethane is kept constant \& other methyl group is permitted to rotate through $\mathrm{C}-\mathrm{C}$ bond axis, an infinite number of atomic arrangements are possible, which are called conformations or conformers\\
(iii) Structure of conformers including bond length \& bond angle in same configuration is also same.\\
(iv) Configuration is also same.\\
(v) Conformers can not be separated so they are not isomers, they are only different forms of same molecule.

Ethane is the best example to demonstrate conformational isomerism. In ethane molecule there is free rotation around the carbon-carbon single bond. The two extreme orientations are:\\
(a) Eclipsed confirmation : In this orientation hydrogen atoms on one carbon are exactly eclipsing the hydrogen atoms on the other. There is minimum distance between two such hydrogen atoms. The eclipsed form has the greater energy content due to maximum repulsive interactions (less stable).\\
(b) Staggered confirmation : In this orientation the hydrogen atoms of one carbon are at maximum possible distance from that of the other. The staggered form has the less energy content due to minimum repulsive interaction (more stable).

$$
\mathrm{E}_{\mathrm{ec} .}-\mathrm{E}_{\mathrm{st} .}=3 \mathrm{kcal} / \mathrm{mole}
$$

The two forms of ethane are rapidly interconvertible at room temperature and are thus not separable.\\

Staggered conformation (I), in which two methyl groups are as far apart as possible, is most stable due to minimum repulsion between the methyl groups. This conformation is also called anti conformation. This on rotation through $60^{\circ}$ gives eclipsed conformation (II), in which methyl group on one carbon is overlapped by the hydrogen atom on the other carbon. Further rotation through $60^{\circ}$ gives another staggered conformation (III) in which methyl groups or two carbons are $60^{\circ}$ apart. This conformation, is also called Gauche conformation. Gauche conformation on further rotation through $60^{\circ}$ gives fully eclipsed conformation (IV) in which two methyl groups on two carbons are just opposite to each other. In this conformation steric strain is maximum hence this conformation is most unstable. Further rotation through $60^{\circ}$ gives again gauche conformation (V) which is mirror image of gauche conformation (III). Conformation (V), on rotation through $60^{\circ}$ gives conformation (VI) which is again eclipsed conformation.

Conformations of cyclohexane : If cyclohexane molecule were to be planar, the C-C-C angle would have been $120^{\circ}$. Therefore, ring would be highly strained. Cyclohexane avoids this strain by assuming conformations in which all bond angles between carbon atoms are close to tetrahedral angle, $109^{\circ} 28^{\prime}$. The two most important conformations of cyclohexane are the chair form and the boat form as shown in fig. Of the two, the chair form is more stable than the boat form, the energy difference being about $30 \mathrm{~kJ} \mathrm{~mol}^{-1}$. However, the energy barrier between the two conformations is of about $44 \mathrm{~kJ} \mathrm{~mol}^{-1}$ ). This is because in the boat form, many hydrogens on adjacent carbons correspond to the unfavourable eclipsed conformation of ethane. Also, the two hydrogens marked $\mathrm{H}_{\alpha}$ also called flagpole hydrogen in the boat form are quite close and repel one another.

On the other hand, the chair form does not have these unfavourable interactions and all the hydrogens correspond to the more stable staggered conformation of ethane.\\

A solution prepared by mixing 10 mL of a 0.10 M solution of the $R$ enantiomer and 30 mL of a 0.10 M solution of the $S$ enantiomer was found to have an observed specific rotation of $+4.8^{\circ}$. What is the specific rotation of each of the enantiomers?\\
Sol. One millimole ( $10 \mathrm{~mL} \times 0.10 \mathrm{M}$ ) of the R enantiomer is mixed with $3 \mathrm{mmol}(30 \mathrm{~mL} \times 0.10 \mathrm{M})$ of the Senantiomer; 1 mmol of the Renantiomer plus 1 mmol of the Senantiomer will form 2 mmol of a racemic mixture. There will be 2 mmol of S enantiomer left over. Therefore, 2 mmol out of 4 mmol is excess S enantiomer ( $2 / 4=0.50$ ). The solution is $50 \%$ optically pure.

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text { Optical purity }=0.50 & =\frac{\text { observed specific rotation }}{\text { specific rotation of the pure enantiomer }} \\
0.50 & =\frac{+4.8^{\circ}}{x} \Rightarrow x=+9.6^{\circ}
\end{aligned}
$$

The S enantiomer has a specific rotation of $+9.6^{\circ}$, the R enantiomer has a specific rotation of $-9.6^{\circ}$.

\section*{REACTION MECHANISM:}
A chemical equation is a symbolic representation of a chemical change. It indicates the initial reactants and final products invoived in a chemical change. Reactants generally consist of two species:\\
(i) One which is being attacked; it is called a substrate.\\
(ii) Other which attacks the substrate; it is referred to as a reagent. These two interact to form products.

Substrate + Reagent $\rightarrow$ Products\\
It is important for us to know not only what happens in a chemical change but also know how it happens. Most of the reactions are complex and take place via intermediates which may or may not be isolated. The intermediates are generally very reactive. They react readily with other species present in the environment to form the final products. The detailed step by step description of a chemical reaction is called its mechanism.\\
Substrate $\longrightarrow$ intermediates $\longrightarrow$ Products\\
Mechanism is only a hypothesis which explains various facts regarding a chemical change.\\
The reactions of organic compounds essentially involve changes in the existing covalent bonds present in their molecules. These changes may involve electronic displacements in the bonds, breaking of the bonds, energy changes accompanying the cleavage and formation of new bonds. To understand clearly the mechanism of various organic reactions, it is thus essential to have knowledge about the following well established concepts:\\
(a) Cleavage (fission or breaking) of covalent bonds, (b) Nature of attacking reagents.\\
(c) Electronic displacements in bonds,

\section*{TYPES OF BOND FISSION :}
\section*{(a) Homolytic (symmetrical) fission or Homolysis:}
(i) If a covalent bond breaks in such a way that each atom takes away one electron of the shared pair, it is called homolytic or symmetrical fission or homolysis.\\
\includegraphics[max width=\textwidth, center]{2025_01_28_8470952b98110cec3aabg-065(1)}\\
(ii) The neutral chemical species (such as A and B) which contain an odd or unpaired electron and which are produced by homolytic fission of covalent bonds are called frec radicals.\\
(iii) Favourable conditions: (a) High temperature (b) Light of suitable wave length (c) Nonpolar solvent (d) Presence of peroxide or oxygen (e) Ability of substrate and attacking reagent to produce free-radicals.\\
(b) Heterolytic Bond Fission or Heterolysis

In heterolysis, the covalent bond is broken in such a way that one species (i.e., less electronegative) is deprived of its own electron, while the other species gains both the electrons.\\
\includegraphics[max width=\textwidth, center]{2025_01_28_8470952b98110cec3aabg-065}

Thus formation of oppositely charged species takes place. In case of organic compounds, if positive charge is present on the carbon then cation is termed as carbocation. If negative charge is present on the carbon then anion is termed as carbanion. Carbocation and carbanion are the reaction intermediates.\\
The factor which favours heterolysis is a greater difference of electronegativity between A and B. Thus\\
(1) Heterolytic bond fission gives carbocation or carbanion as reaction intermediate.\\
(2) Mechanism of the reaction in which heterolytic bond fission takes place is known as heterolytic mechanism or ionic mechanism.\\
(3) The energy required for heterolytic bond fission is always greater than that for homolytic bond fission due to electrostatic force of attraction between ions.

Fivourable conditions : (a) Low temperature (b) Polar solvent (c) Presence of acid or base as catalyst (d) Polar nature of the substrate and attacking reagent.

\section*{CLASSIFICATION OF REAGENTS:}
Electrophiles or electrophilic reagents $\left(\mathrm{E}^{+}\right)$:\\
(i) These are electron deficient species.\\
(ii) These are always in search of electrons.\\
(iii) These have a tendency to accept electron pair from another molecule, (electro = electron, phile = love).\\
(iv) In a reaction, an electrophile attacks the substrate at the point of maximum electron density.

Electrophiles may be neutral or positively charged.\\
In neutral electrophiles, central atom has deficiency of electrons e.g. $\mathrm{BF}_{3}, \mathrm{BCl}_{3}, \mathrm{AlCl}_{3}, \mathrm{BeCl}_{2}, \mathrm{FeCl}_{3}, \mathrm{SO}_{3}$, etc.\\
(v) All the positive ions behave like electrophiles.

$$
\mathrm{Cl}^{+}, \mathrm{Br}^{+}, \mathrm{I}^{+}, \mathrm{NO}_{2}^{+}, \mathrm{NO}^{+}, \mathrm{H}^{+}, \mathrm{H}_{3} \mathrm{O}^{+}, \stackrel{+}{\mathrm{N}} \mathrm{H}_{4}, \mathrm{R}^{+}, \mathrm{R}-\stackrel{+}{\mathrm{C}}=\mathrm{O} \text {, etc. }
$$

(vi) Electrophiles are generated by heterolysis of a covalent bond.\\
(vii) Transitional metal cations are electrophiles, viz $\mathrm{Fe}^{3+}, \mathrm{Fe}^{2+}, \mathrm{Ag}^{+}, \mathrm{Hg}^{2+}, \mathrm{Cd}^{2+}$, etc.\\
(viii) All Lewis acids are electrophiles.

\section*{Nucleophilic reagents or Nucleophiles ( $\mathrm{Nu}^{-}$):}
(i) These are electron rich species, and have a tendency to donate electron pair.\\
(ii) These attack of the centre of minimum electron density in a chemical reaction.

These are of two types:\\
(a) Charged nucleophiles : All the negative ions qualify as nucleophiles.\\
$\mathrm{F}^{-}, \mathrm{Cl}^{-}, \mathrm{Br}^{-}, \mathrm{I}^{-}, \mathrm{OH}^{-}, \mathrm{CN}^{-}, \mathrm{RCOO}^{-}, \mathrm{RO}^{-}, \mathrm{R}^{-}, \mathrm{R}-\mathrm{C} \equiv \mathrm{C}^{-}, \overrightarrow{\mathrm{N}}_{2}, \stackrel{-}{\mathrm{S}} \mathrm{H}$, etc.\\
(b) Neutral nucleophiles: Central atom has electron pair.

$$
\ddot{\mathrm{N}} \mathrm{H}_{3}, \mathrm{R}-\ddot{\mathrm{N}} \mathrm{H}_{2}, \mathrm{R}-\ddot{\mathrm{N}} \mathrm{HR}, \mathrm{R}_{3} \ddot{\mathrm{~N}}, \mathrm{H}_{2} \ddot{\mathrm{O}}: \mathrm{R}-\ddot{\mathrm{O}}-\mathrm{H}, \mathrm{R}-\ddot{\mathrm{O}}-\mathrm{R}, \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{~S}, \mathrm{R}-\ddot{\mathrm{S}}-\mathrm{R} \text {, }
$$

\end{center}

\section*{ELECTRON DISPLACEMENT IN ORGANICMOLECULES:}
In organic molecules different reactions depend on the electron density in their molecules. Since majority of attacking reagents are polar, i.e. nucleophilic or electrophilic, hence in organic compounds permanent or temporary polarity is developed by temporary (or) permanent electron displacements.\\
The different electronic effects which operate in covalent bonds are\\
(a) Inductive effect\\
(b) Mesomeric and resonance effect\\
(c) Electromeric effect and (d) Hyperconjugation\\
(a) Inductive effect : In a covalent single bond between unlike atoms, electron pair forming the $\sigma$ bond is never shared absolutely equally between the two atoms; it tends to be attracted a little more towards the more electronegative atom of the two. Thus in an alkyl chloride, electron density tends to be greater nearer to chloririe than to carbon, as the former is more electronegative; this is generally represented as in\\
\includegraphics[max width=\textwidth, center]{2025_01_28_8470952b98110cec3aabg-066(1)}

If the carbon atom bonded to chlorine is itself attached to further carbon atoms, the effect can be transmitted further . For example, thus $\mathrm{C}_{1}$ becomes $\mathrm{C}_{2} \mathrm{H}_{5}-\mathrm{Cl}$.\\
\includegraphics[max width=\textwidth, center]{2025_01_28_8470952b98110cec3aabg-067(2)}

In ethyl chloride, electronegativity of chlorine causes displacement of electrons of $\mathrm{C}_{1}-\mathrm{Cl}$ bond to Cl with the result Cl attains a partial negative charge $\left(\delta^{-}\right)$while $C_{1}$ attains a partial positive charge $(\delta+)$. Thus $\mathrm{C}_{1}$ becomes slightly electron deficient and hence attracts electrons of the $\sigma$ bond between $C_{1}$ and $C_{2}$. However, the effect of $C_{1}$ on $C_{2}$ is less than the effect of $\mathrm{Cl}_{\text {on }} \mathrm{C}_{1}$. In other words, it decreases as the distance from source (more electronegative atom) increases. From practical point of view, it may be neglected after third carbon atom.\\
Inductive effect is denoted by the symbol 'I' and represented by a straight arrow $(\rightarrow-)$, the arrow head pointing towards the source (more electronegative element). The inductive effect causes certain degree of polarity in the bond which in term renders the bond much more liable to be attacked by other charged atoms (or) group.\\
The characteristics of inductive effect are : (i) A permanent effect (ii) The electrons never leave their original atomic orbital.\\
(iii) Operate through $\sigma$ bond. (iv) Polarisation of electrons is always in single direction. (v) Its magnitude (i.e. electron with drawing or donating power) decreases with increase in distance.\\
(i) -I effect: Atoms or group of atoms which attract the bonded electrons more strongly than hydrogen atom, are said to have\\
$-I$ effect and are termed as electron attracting ( -I groups). Such groups when linked with a carbon chain make it electron poor.

Ex. $-\stackrel{+}{\mathrm{N}} \mathrm{R}_{3}>-\mathrm{NO}_{2}>-\mathrm{CN}>-\mathrm{COOH}>-\mathrm{F}>-\mathrm{Cl}>-\mathrm{Br}>-\mathrm{I}>-\mathrm{OH}>-\mathrm{OR}>\mathrm{C}_{6} \mathrm{H}_{5}>-\mathrm{H}$\\
(ii) + I Effect : Those atoms or group of atoms which attract the shared electron pair (bond pair) less strongly then hydrogen atom are said to have +I (electron repelling) effect. Such groups when attached with a carbon chain displace the shared $\sigma$ electrons towards the chain and make it electron rich.

$$
\left(\mathrm{CH}_{3}\right)_{3} \mathrm{C}->\left(\mathrm{CH}_{3}\right)_{2} \mathrm{CH}->\mathrm{CH}_{3}-\mathrm{CH}_{2}->\mathrm{CH}_{3}-
$$

Inductive effect of hydrogen is zero, i.e. it neither attracts nor repels the bond pair between carbon and hydrogen.

\section*{Applications of inductive effect:}
(i) Dipole moment: Since, inductive effect leads to a dipolar character in the molecule which develops some dipole moment in the molecule. Dipole moment increases with increase in inductive effect.\\
\includegraphics[max width=\textwidth, center]{2025_01_28_8470952b98110cec3aabg-067(3)}\\
(ii) In bond length: With increase in inductive effect, the bond length usually decreases because of increased ionic character,\\
\includegraphics[max width=\textwidth, center]{2025_01_28_8470952b98110cec3aabg-067}\\
(iii) Reactivity of alkyl halides: The carbon-halogen bond in tertiary alkyl halides is most reactive while it is least reactive in primary alkyl halides. This can be explained on the basis of greater +1 effect in $t$-alkyl halides which pushes the I effect; hence the bond becomes highly polar and weak.\\
\includegraphics[max width=\textwidth, center]{2025_01_28_8470952b98110cec3aabg-067(1)}\\
(iii) Strength of fatty acids: As the number of alkyl groups attached to- COOH group increases, the acid strength decreases. Thus formic acid is stronger acid than acetic acid which is stronger than propionic acid and so on, due to increasing +1 effect of alkyl groups.\\
\includegraphics{smile-98e044856c3899dd2c953ad837b1acb41a5efca5}

Propanoic acid\\
(iv) Strength of substituted acids: Chlorinated acetic acids are stronger than acetic acid due to - I effect of chlorine atom.\\
\includegraphics{smile-cb9789e5ea089f617e083f807147e206af0c0030}\\
\includegraphics{smile-e2b9e0831fdf654ee11025cff58856a64241ca54}

Larger the number of chlorine atoms, greater will be the-I effect and stronger will be the acid.\\
\includegraphics{smile-1c42cfd2432c3abdd73c76b7e8e7f90d3d8ae1d4}\\

The relative strength of the different halogen substituted acids :\\
$\mathrm{FCH}_{2} \mathrm{COOH}>\mathrm{ClCH}_{2} \mathrm{COOH}>\mathrm{BrCH}_{2} \mathrm{COOH}>\mathrm{ICH}_{2} \mathrm{COOH}$\\
(v) Basicity of aliphatic primary amines : In aliphatic amines $\left(\mathrm{R}-\mathrm{NH}_{2}\right)$, the +I alkyl group increases the electron density on nitrogen atom of $-\mathrm{NH}_{2}$ group. As a result, its tendency to donate the electron pair to a proton increases.\\
Increasing order of basic strength of aliphatic primary amines is :

$$
\mathrm{NH}_{3}<\left(\mathrm{CH}_{3}\right)_{3} \mathrm{~N}<\mathrm{CH}_{3} \mathrm{NH}_{2}<\mathrm{CH}_{3} \mathrm{CH}_{2} \mathrm{NH}_{2}<\left(\mathrm{CH}_{3}\right)_{2} \mathrm{NH}
$$

Base strength of aliphatic and aromatic amines varies as follows: $\mathrm{R}-\mathrm{NH}_{2}>\mathrm{NH}_{3}>\mathrm{Ar}-\mathrm{NH}_{2}$

\section*{ELECTROMERIC EFFECT (E-EFFECT):}
The electromeric effect may be defined as the temporary effect which operates in the organic compounds having multiple bonds i.e. double or triple bonds under the influence of an outside attacking species. As a result, one $\pi$ electron pair of the multiple bond gets completely transferred to one of the bonded atoms which is usually more electronegative.\\
The electromeric effect is shown by a curved arrow ( $\sim \wedge$ ) representing the electron transfer originating from the centre of the multiple bond and pointing towards one of the atoms which is more electronegative.\\
The effect can be illustrated by the attack of $\mathrm{H}^{+}$ion on the molecule of alkene.\\
\includegraphics[max width=\textwidth, center]{2025_01_28_8470952b98110cec3aabg-068(1)}

Types of electromeric effect : The electromeric effect is of two types i.e. + E-effect and - E-effect.\\
(a) + E-effect:- If the $\pi$-electron pair of the multiple bond is transferred to the atom to which the attacking reagent gets attached, the effect is called + Eeffect. For example,\\
\includegraphics[max width=\textwidth, center]{2025_01_28_8470952b98110cec3aabg-068}

In this case, $\mathrm{CH}_{3}$ group has +1 (inductive) effect and the $\pi$-electron shift can take place only to the right.\\
(b) -E-effect:- In case the $\pi$-electron pair of the multiple bond is transferred away from the atom which gets linked to the attacking reagent, the effect is known as -E-effect. For example, attack of $\mathrm{CN}^{-}$ion on formaldehyde,\\
\includegraphics[max width=\textwidth, center]{2025_01_28_8470952b98110cec3aabg-069(2)}

\section*{MESOMERIC EFFECT OR RESONANCE :}
Mesomeric effect ( M effect) operates only in the molecules having a conjugated system, i.e., only in the molecules having alternate single and double bonds. As a result of mesomeric effect, the $\pi$-electrons are delocalized giving rise to a number of resonance structures of the molecule.\\
The atoms or groups which draw electrons away from carbon atom are said to have a -M effect.\\
-M effect atoms or groups: $\mathrm{NO}_{2}, \mathrm{CN},>\mathrm{C}=\mathrm{O}$\\
The atoms or groups which release electrons towards carbon atom are said to have $\mathrm{a}+\mathrm{M}$ effect.\\
+M effect atoms or groups : $\mathrm{Cl}, \mathrm{Br}, \mathrm{I}, \mathrm{NH}_{2}, \mathrm{NR}_{2}, \mathrm{OH}, \mathrm{OCH}_{3}$\\
The +M effect of Cl atom is shown :\\
\includegraphics[max width=\textwidth, center]{2025_01_28_8470952b98110cec3aabg-069(3)}

The - M effect of nitro group is shown :\\
\includegraphics[max width=\textwidth, center]{2025_01_28_8470952b98110cec3aabg-069}

\section*{RESONANCE}
There are many organic compounds which can be represented by two or more such structures which have same arrangement of atoms but different arrangements of electrons. All properties of these compounds cannot be explained by any one of these structure because actual structure of these compounds is combined form of all possible structures. This phenomenon is called resonance. All possible structures are known as resonating structures or canonical forms and the combined form of all these resonating structures which can explain all the properties of that compound is termed as resonance hybrid.

An example is that of benzene which has three alternate double bonds.\\
\includegraphics{smile-5337aa87fc0acee3a2895fd27a02280bcd9fb5e9}

As per this structure of benzene, it should exhibit two different bond lengths due to three $\mathrm{C}-\mathrm{C}$ bonds and three $\mathrm{C}=\mathrm{C}$ double bond. However, as determined experimentally all the six C - C bond length is $1.39 \AA$. This value is in between $\mathrm{C}-\mathrm{C} \& \mathrm{C}=\mathrm{C}$ bond length. Thus, the structure of benzene cannot be represented adequately by the above structure but it is a resonance hybrid of following two resonating structures (I \& II).\\
\includegraphics[max width=\textwidth, center]{2025_01_28_8470952b98110cec3aabg-069(1)}

Resonance hybrid

The resonances structures are hypothetical and individually do not represent any real molecule. They contribute to the actual structure in proportion of their stability.\\
Energy of actual molecule (resonance hybrid) is less than that any of the resonating structures.\\
The difference of energy between the actual structure and most stable resonance structures (structures with lowest energy) is called the resonance energy or resonance stabilization energy. The more the number of resonating structures, more is the resonance energy. Resonance is particularly important when contributing structures have equivalent energy.\\
Some important points regarding resonance are :

\begin{enumerate}
  \item The resonating structures have same position of atoms or nuclei.
  \item All resonating structures have same number of unpaired electrons.
\end{enumerate}

3 Energy of different resonating structures is same or almost similar.\\
4. Among various resonating structures of a compound the resonating structure will be stable where\\
(a) number of covalent bond is more.\\
(b) there is less separation of opposite charges.\\
(c) negative charge is present on more electronegative atom.\\
(d) positive charge is present on less electronegative atom.\\
5. Atoms which take part in resonance should lie in same plane.

\section*{Rules for drawing resonance contributors:}
In order to draw resonance contributors, the electrons in one resonance contribution are moved to generate the next resonance contributor. As you draw contributing resonating structures, note that only electrons move. The nuclei of the atoms never move. Further the only electrons that can move are $\pi$ electrons and nonbonding electrons. Also notice that the total number of electrons in the molecule does not change, nor do the number of paired and unpaired electrons. The electrons can be moved in one of the following ways.

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Move $\pi$ electrons toward a positive charge or toward a $\sigma$ bond or toward an electronegative atom
  \item Move a nonbonding pair of electrons toward a $\sigma$ bond.
\end{enumerate}

\section*{3. Move a single non bonding electron toward a $\sigma$ bond.}
Note that in all cases, the electrons are moved toward an $s p^{2}$ hybridized atom. (Remember that an $s p^{2}$ hybridized carbon is either a doubly-bonded carbon or a carbon that has a positive charge or an unpaired electron.) Electrons cannot be moved toward an $s p^{3}$ hybridized carbon because an $s p^{3}$ hybridized carbon has four $\sigma$ bonds and cannot accommodate any more electrons.\\

\section*{Conditions for resonance:}
(i) The atomic arrangement is the same in all canonical forms.\\
(ii) Same number of paired or unpaired electrons must be present in each canonical form.\\
(iii) The canonical forms must possess same or nearly same energy.\\
(iv) The molecule must have a planar structure,\\
(v) All canonical forms do not contribute equally towards the structure of a resonance hybrid. A more stable canonical structure contributes more to the resonance hybrid. The contribution depends upon the following factors.\\
(a) Neutral species is more stable than the charged (or dipolar species).\\
(b) Species having complete octet is more stable than the species having incomplete octet\\
\includegraphics[max width=\textwidth, center]{2025_01_28_8470952b98110cec3aabg-071(1)}\\
(I) and (II) are resonating structures of acyl cation, (II) will be more sable than (I).\\
(c) If all structures have formal charge, the most stable one is that in which the positive and negative charges reside on the most electropositive and most electronegative atoms of the species respectively. For example,\\
(i)\\
\includegraphics{smile-8581aedaf231101304415b52fcdfd2392648b860}\\
\includegraphics{smile-d6862c9fb1969bf85b042654ccd8f7ed365926e2}\\
(ii) carbonyl group is although a resonance hybrid of the following structures,\\
\includegraphics[max width=\textwidth, center]{2025_01_28_8470952b98110cec3aabg-071}\\
the polar structure (II) is more stable than (III) because in this structure negative charge resides on oxygen (more electronegative atom) and positive charge is present on more electropositive carbon atom.\\
(d) Resonating structure with a greater number of covalent bonds is more stable.\\
(e) Increase in charge separation decreases the stability of a resonating structure.\\
\includegraphics[max width=\textwidth, center]{2025_01_28_8470952b98110cec3aabg-071(3)}

Hence stability of II and IV will be the same and both will be more stable than III. The order of stability of resonating structures in decreasing order will be as follows :

$$
\mathrm{I}>\mathrm{II} \equiv \mathrm{IV}>\mathrm{III}
$$

(f) Resonating structure having electron deficient positively charged atom has very high energy and hence unstable.

Characteristics of resonance and resonance hybrid :\\
(i) A resonance hybrid is more stable than any of the canonical forms. Greater the number of resonating structures which can be written for a molecule, greater will be its stability. Thus, resonance gives extra stability to a molecule and hence decreases its reactivity. Resonance hybrid possesses lesser energy than any of the canonical forms.

Resonance energy : It is a measure of the stability of a resonance hybrid. It may be defined as, "the difference in the energy of most stable (maximum contributing) canonical form and the resonance hybrid",\\
Resonance energy $=$ Theoretical heat of formation - Experimental heat of formation.\\
Higher the resonance energy of a molecule greater is its stability.\\
(ii) Bond lengths between atoms in a resonance hybrid are different from those in canonical forms. For example, in actual benzene molecule the carbon-carbon bond distance between adjacent atoms is equal ( $1.397 \AA$ ) while in the Kekule structure, it is $1.54 \AA$ and $1.34 \AA$ alternately.\\
Resonance and bond order: Bond order in conjugated compound or bond order in compounds which exhibit resonance

$$
=\frac{\text { Total number of bonds on central atom }}{\text { Number of resonating structures }}
$$

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[max width=\textwidth]{2025_01_28_8470952b98110cec3aabg-072(1)}
\end{center}

Bond order of carbon in benzene $=\frac{2+1}{2}=1.5$\\
Examples: (i) Bond order between carbon and oxygen in carbonate $\left(\mathrm{CO}_{3}{ }^{2-}\right)$ ion : All the $\mathrm{C}-\mathrm{O}$ bond distances are equal in this ion due to resonance\\
\includegraphics[max width=\textwidth, center]{2025_01_28_8470952b98110cec3aabg-072(2)}\\
(ii) $\quad \mathrm{N}-\mathrm{O}$ bond order in nitrate $\left(\mathrm{NO}_{3}^{-}\right)$ion:\\

(iii) Bond order in $\mathrm{SO}_{3}$ :\\
\includegraphics[max width=\textwidth, center]{2025_01_28_8470952b98110cec3aabg-072}

Bond order be lween Sand $\mathrm{O}=\frac{2+1+1}{3}=\frac{4}{3}=1.33$\\
Steric Inhibition of Resonance: The most important condition for resonance to occur is that the involved atoms in resonating structure must be coplanar or nearly coplanar for maximum resonance. If this condition does not fulfill, the invoived orbitals cannot be parallel to each other and as a consequence delocalisation of electrons or positive charge cannot occur. The planarity of orbitals are inhibited by the bulky groups present on adjacent atoms. This phenomenon is known as steric inhibition of resonance. For example, in dimethyl, aniline ( l , the orbital having lone pair of electrons on nitrogen atom is in the plane of the benzene hence this takes part in the delocalisation over the benzene ring.\\
\includegraphics{smile-bac49b3fe39b9dc99935503baaa0c0cea7ab00fe}\\
\includegraphics{smile-c1971e259c359d09db02df9242477b1da352db9f}

In $\mathrm{N}, \mathrm{N}$-dimethyl-2, 6-dinitroaniline (II) the $\ddot{\mathrm{N}}\left(\mathrm{CH}_{3}\right)_{2}$ group is out of the plane of the benzene ring due to the presence of the two bulky nitro groups and consequently the lone pair of electrons on the nitrogen atoms of $\ddot{\mathrm{N}}\left(\mathrm{CH}_{3}\right)_{2}$ group cannot get delocalised over the benzene ring. Thus bulky groups present at ortho positions inhibit delocalisation of lone pair of electrons or positive charge present on key atom of the molecule. Steric inhibition of resonance has profound effect on:\\
(i) Physical properties (ii) Acidity and basicity and (iii) Reactivity of organic compounds

In nitrobenzene (I) bond length between carbon-nitrogen (bond -a) is in between single and double bonds due to the resonance but in compound (II), bond length between carbon-nitrogen is only of single bond due to the inhibition of resonance.\\
\includegraphics[max width=\textwidth, center]{2025_01_28_8470952b98110cec3aabg-073}

Bond strength is dependent on the extent of the overlap of the combining atomic orbitals, so that in these conjugated systems the more nearly equal in size the $p$-orbitals are, the more effective is the $\pi$-orbital overlap. Hence fluorine is more effective than chlorine in conjugating with carbon, and oxygen is more effective than sulphur. Hence the order of + M effects is: $-\mathrm{NR}_{2}>-\mathrm{OR}>-\mathrm{F}$\\
$+M$ effect possessing groups are: $-\ddot{O} \mathrm{H},-\ddot{\mathrm{O}} \mathrm{R},-\ddot{\mathrm{N}} \mathrm{H}_{2},-\ddot{\mathrm{N}} \mathrm{HR},-\ddot{\mathrm{N}} \mathrm{R}_{2},-\ddot{\mathrm{S}} \mathrm{R},-\ddot{\mathrm{X}}:$ etc.\\
-M effect possessing groups are: $-\mathrm{CHO}, \mathrm{CO},-\mathrm{CN},-\mathrm{NO}_{2},-\mathrm{SO}_{3} \mathrm{H}$ etc.

\section*{APPLICATION OF MESOMERIC OR RESONANCE}
(i) Effect of resonance on the structure : Resonance decreases bond length of single bond and increases bond length of double bond in real structure. Consider structure of benzene:\\

\includegraphics{smile-357971878e566dc52102dd64c43e92405d711d65}\\
II

I and II are resonating structures of benzene.\\
(a) According to resonating structure I, C-C bond length between $\mathrm{C}_{1}$ and $\mathrm{C}_{2}$ will be $1.33 \AA$\\
(b) According to resonating structure II, C-C bond length between $\mathrm{C}_{1}$ and $\mathrm{C}_{2}$ will be $1.54 \AA$\\
(c) According to resonance, bond length between $\mathrm{C}_{1}$ and $\mathrm{C}_{2}$ will neither be 1.33 nor $1.54 \AA$, but it will be in between $1.33 \AA \& 1.54 \AA$, i.e, , bond length between $C_{1} \& C_{2}$ is $>1.33 \AA \&<1.54 \AA$.\\
(d) experimental value is $1.40 \AA$, this result coincides with the result obtained by resonance\\
(ii) The low reactivity of halogens: The low reactivity of halogens bonded to unsaturated carbon is due to the +M effect of the halogen. The $\mathrm{C}-\mathrm{Br}$ bond in vinyl bromide has a partial double-bond character due to the +M effect of bromine with consequent low reactivity of bromine.

$$
\stackrel{C}{\mathrm{H}}_{2}=\mathrm{CH} \stackrel{\ominus}{\mathrm{Br}} \longleftrightarrow \stackrel{\ominus}{\mathrm{C}} \mathrm{H}_{2}-\mathrm{CH}=\stackrel{(8)}{\mathrm{Br}}
$$

(iii) Acidity of phenol : The acidity of phenol is due to the +M effect of OH group. The mesomeric transfer of the lone pair on the oxygen atom of phenol to the $\pi$ electrons of the benzene ring results in several resonance structures with positive charge on the oxygen atom which aids the hydrogen atom of OH group to leave as proton.\\
\includegraphics[max width=\textwidth, center]{2025_01_28_8470952b98110cec3aabg-074(1)}

The ionization is specially aided due to the formation of the relatively more stable phenoxide ion. The charge delocalization in phenoxide ion affords greater stability over phenol in which charge separation occurs in the canonical forms.\\
\includegraphics[max width=\textwidth, center]{2025_01_28_8470952b98110cec3aabg-074}

Hence, phenol prefers to ionize, i.e. it is acidic .\\
(iv) Aromatic character of compounds

According to the Hückel rule, a compound will be aromatic if it fulfils the following four conditions:\\
(a) Compound should be cyclic\\
(b) Compound should be planar\\
(c) Compound should be conjugated : (1) Double bond, Single bond, Double bond (2) Double bond, Single bond, electron pair\\
(3) Double bond, single bond, positive charge\\
(iv) Compound should have $(4 n+2) \pi$ conjugated or delocalised electrons where $n$ is a whole number $n=0,1,2$,\\
$3, \ldots . . . .4 n$

Anti-Aromatic compounds : According to Huckel rule, compound will be anti-aromatic if it will fulfil the following four conditions:\\
(i) Compound should be cyclic (ii) Compound should be planar (iii) compound should be conjugated and (iv) Compound should have ( $4 n$ ) $\pi$ conjugated or delocalised electrons where $n$ is whole number.\\
$n=1,2,3,4,5,6$\\
\includegraphics[max width=\textwidth, center]{2025_01_28_8470952b98110cec3aabg-074(2)}

Exception : Although cyclooctatetraene has ( $4 n$ ) $\pi$ electrons even then it is not an antiaromatic.\\
Geometry of this compound is non planar\\
\includegraphics{smile-3887cb538fcf301011c7795c11e33ade40b210a5}

\footnotetext{\begin{itemize}
  \item Remember that the lone pair of electrons on N is not a part of $6 \pi$ electrons (aromatic sextet).
\end{itemize}
}Aromatic compounds are diamagnetic in character whereas anti-aromatic compounds are paramagnetic in character:\\
(v) Stability of conjugated species :\\
(1) Stability of a conjugated compound is more than the corresponding non-conjugated compound. For example

$$
\mathrm{CH}_{2}=\mathrm{CH}-\mathrm{CH}=\mathrm{CH}-\mathrm{CH}_{2}
$$

(I)

Conjugated compound\\
\includegraphics[max width=\textwidth, center]{2025_01_28_8470952b98110cec3aabg-075(1)}\\
(II)

Non-conjugated compound

Hence (I) will be more stable than (II)\\
(2) Stability of an aromatic compound is more than the corresponding non-aromatic conjugated compound. For example, (III) is more stable than (IV)\\
\includegraphics{smile-945fe9ba05cfa17af6a186bc38fbe689a814b555}\\

(IV)

Conjugated non-aromatic compound

Aromatic compound\\
Thus stability series of different compounds in decreasing order is as follows :\\
Aromatic compound $>$ conjugated non-aromatic compound $>$ non-conjugated compound $>$ anti-aromatic

$$
\mathrm{CH}_{2}=\mathrm{CH}-\stackrel{\oplus}{\mathrm{C}} \mathrm{H}_{2}
$$

Number of resonating structures $=2$

$$
\mathrm{C}_{6} \mathrm{H}_{5}-\stackrel{\stackrel{\text { セ. }}{\mathrm{C}} \mathrm{H}_{2}}{ }
$$

Number of resonating structures $=4$

Hence the benzyl carbocation is more stable than the allyl carbocation.\\
(vi) Stability of substituted benzyl carbocations: Stability of substituted benzyl carbocation depends on the nature of group present in the benzene ring. The group may exert $+\mathrm{I},-\mathrm{I},+\mathrm{R}$ or -R effect.\\
Case I: When ring has a group which exerts -I and -M group

\begin{itemize}
  \item I group withdraws electrons, increases magnitude of positive charge, hence decreases stability.\\
\includegraphics[max width=\textwidth, center]{2025_01_28_8470952b98110cec3aabg-075}
  \item M group, when present at $o$ - or $p$-position, withdraws electrons, increases magnitude of positive charge, hence decreases stability.\\
\includegraphics{smile-1d67ce6c009f176cab1d5c750ff5aed2724d3bff}\\
(I)\\
\includegraphics{smile-3c3429340f9c353f5c754a9e9e0ed01101e6ae95}\\
(II)\\
\includegraphics{smile-d0f9261f2727809350351238f1dbb2a4710cdafc}\\
(III)\\
(i) Increase in the magnitude of positive charge by $-I$ and $-M$ effects\\
(i) Increase in positive charge only by-I effect\\
(i) Increase in positive charge by -1 and -M effects\\
(ii) -I power is minimum\\
(ii) - I and - M power is maximum
\end{itemize}

Hence (II) is more stable than (III) which is more stable than (I).\\
Thus meta derivative is more stable than $p$-derivative which is more stable than 0 -derivative.\\
Case II : When ring has a group which is +I group.\\
\includegraphics{smile-b403436adf6ef8be76013fe8b11796e55b3ee2d6}\\
(I)\\

(II)\\
\includegraphics{smile-55ffe2790ea44392ff14044c76aa945c66dc2a27}\\
(III)

Positive charge is decreased by +I , thus\\
Stabilised by + I group\\
Stabilised by +I effect stability increased by + I group. hence (I) is more stable than (II) which is more stable than (III).\\
Thus $o$-derivative is more stable than $m$-derivative which is more stable than $p$-derivative.\\
Case-III: When group has $+M$ effect and $-I$ effect.\\
\includegraphics[max width=\textwidth, center]{2025_01_28_8470952b98110cec3aabg-076(1)}

Hence $p$-derivative is more stable than $\sigma$-derivative which is more stable than $m$-derivative.\\
In case of halo derivatives also, result depends on $-I$ and $+M$ effects of the group.\\

Case I: When group has $+I$ effect.\\
\includegraphics[max width=\textwidth, center]{2025_01_28_8470952b98110cec3aabg-076(3)}

Hence $m$-derivative is more stable than $p$-derivative which is more stable than $o$-derivative\\
Case-II: When group has -R and -I effects.\\
\includegraphics[max width=\textwidth, center]{2025_01_28_8470952b98110cec3aabg-076(2)}

Thus $o$-derivative is more stable than $p$-derivative which is more stable than $m$-derivative.\\
\includegraphics[max width=\textwidth, center]{2025_01_28_8470952b98110cec3aabg-076}\\
(viii) Acidity of aromatic acids : Acidity of carboxylic acids depends on the stability of acid anion thus.

Electron withdrawing group stabilises anion, hence increases acidity.\\
\includegraphics{smile-c327fc8212932eab7e615e0323778d022a9838ec}

Similarly, electron donating group destabilises anion, hence decreases acidity.\\
\includegraphics{smile-343ea297f8d4100e258d31b6a438998718129584}

The first member of aromatic acids is benzoic acid which dissociates as follows.\\
\includegraphics[max width=\textwidth, center]{2025_01_28_8470952b98110cec3aabg-077(1)}

Thus acidity of benzoic acid will depend on the stability of benzoate anion which is only stabilised by inductive effect and not by resonance because carboxylic group and carboxylate ion are not in the plane of the ring. These two groups will not take part in the delocalisation with the benzene ring.\\
Acidity of substituted acids: Ortho substituted benzoic acids are always strong acids than the $m$ - and $p$-derivatives due to ortho effect.\\
Case 1: When group is -M and -I group.\\
\includegraphics[max width=\textwidth, center]{2025_01_28_8470952b98110cec3aabg-077(2)}\\

(II)\\
\includegraphics{smile-4f7e1908f93d58ffb2115b430fddf5ebd72edc96}\\
(III)

Carbon becomes electron deficient due to resonance effect of $\mathrm{NO}_{2}$ group. This electron deficient carbon withdraws electrons from the carboxylategroup by inductive effect. Thus anion is stabilised by $-M$ and $-I$ effects and $-I$ power is maximum

Anion is stabilised only by -I effect of $\mathrm{NO}_{2}$ group\\
\includegraphics[max width=\textwidth, center]{2025_01_28_8470952b98110cec3aabg-077}\\
\includegraphics{smile-0f6c96f7754d459ab10e2c54a3129b671afde506}\\
(IV)

Anion is stabilised by -M and -I effects of the $\mathrm{NO}_{2}$ group\\
Thus decreasing order of the stability of these anions is follows: I $>$ III $>$ II $>$ IV

We know that ortho derivative is the most acidic therefore decreasing order of acidity of these acids is as follows : $\xrightarrow[\text { Acidity in decreasing order }]{o \text {-derivative }>p \text {-derivative }>m \text {-derivative }>\text { benzoic acid }}$

Case II: When group has only +I effect.\\
\includegraphics{smile-3e52fb6fef623bcaa5eb89900dd8e4a2158e1466}

Ortho derivative will be most acidic due to ortho effect.\\
\includegraphics{smile-54412115e1c3ca7f3885009ffd5d56ee2aadfdf5}

Anion is destabilised due to +1 effect\\
\includegraphics{smile-7f1a7d0354d0a9d65432b9d5f3674eb92772fa77}

Anion is destabilised by +I effect and +1 power is minimum\\
$\xrightarrow[\text { Thus benzoic acid }>0 \text {-derivative }>m \text {-derivative }>p \text {-derivative }]{\text { Acidy in decreasing order }}$\\
Case III: When group has +M and -I effect\\

\section*{(ix) Basicity of aromatic amines:}
(a) Basicity of nitrogen containing compounds $\propto$ Electrons on nitrogen

In aromatic amines, lone pair of electrons present on nitrogen is delocalised, hence, electron density decreases due to resonance.

Thus Bascicity $\propto \frac{1}{\text { Number of resonating structures }}$

\section*{Structure Number of resonating structures}

Hence (II) is more basic than (I)\\
(c) Basicity of substituted anilines: Para substituted aniline is more basic than ortho substituted aniline and the effect is known as para effect.\\
Case I: When group has -R and -I effect.\\

Thus aniline will be least basic and p-derivative will be most basic hence order of basicity is as follows

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[max width=\textwidth]{2025_01_28_8470952b98110cec3aabg-080(1)}

Due to delocalisation and - I effect of CO group, amides are less basic than amines.\\
\includegraphics{smile-daf689728c306f28541ce9f4fd2d77f7b0fb0cf7}

In benzamide, there is cross conjugation which increases basicity; thus $\mathrm{C}_{6} \mathrm{H}_{5} \mathrm{CONH}_{2}$ is more basic than $\mathrm{CH}_{3} \mathrm{CONH}_{2}$ ; $\pi$ bond of $\mathrm{C}=\mathrm{O}$ group is in conjugation to benzene ring as well as $/ p$ of $\mathrm{NH}_{2}$ groups.\\
(x) Acidity of $\alpha$-hydrogens : $\alpha$-Hydrogen of carbonyl compounds, nitrites, acids and nitro compounds are acidic in character. In other words we can say that\\
(i) $\alpha$-hydrogens are acidic in character when-I group is present on the $\alpha$-carbon.\\
(ii) acidity of $\alpha$-hydrogens depends on the stability of carbanion $\stackrel{\ominus}{\mathrm{C}} \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{G}$ which is obtained by the ionisation of thecompound.\\
Stability of anion depends on two factors.:\\
(a) Stability of carbanion $\propto-1$ power of the group present on $\alpha$-carbon

For example,

$$
\stackrel{\alpha}{\mathrm{CH}_{3}}-\mathrm{NO}_{2} \quad \stackrel{\stackrel{\alpha}{\mathrm{C}} \mathrm{C}_{2}-\mathrm{NO}_{2}}{\mathrm{NO}_{2}}
$$

\begin{itemize}
  \item I power in increasing order; acidity in increasing order\\
(b) Stability of carbanion $\propto$ number of resonating structures.\\
\includegraphics[max width=\textwidth, center]{2025_01_28_8470952b98110cec3aabg-080(2)}
\end{itemize}

Thus $\alpha$-hydrogen of nitromethane is acidic due to inductive effect as well as delocalisation of negative charge.

\section*{HYPERCONJUGATION, BAKER -NATHAN EFFECT (NO BOND RESONANCE):}
It involves delocalization of $\mathrm{C}-\mathrm{H}$ sigma ( $\sigma$ ) electrons with $\pi$-electrons of a multiple bond when they are in conjugation. Therefore, it is also called $\sigma-\pi$ conjugation. In the system $H \quad \sigma-C=C$, the $\sigma$ electrons of $C-H$ bond are released in the unsaturated carbon chain. This phenomenon is called hyperconjugation.\\
\includegraphics[max width=\textwidth, center]{2025_01_28_8470952b98110cec3aabg-081}

The hydrogen atom of the $\mathrm{H} \underline{\sigma}$ C bond acquires a + ve charge but remains very close to carbon atom although there is not any bond between the two. Hence, the name no-bond resonance for hyperconjugation. Greater the number of H C bonds attached to an unsaturated system, more will be the electron release in the unsaturated carbon chain, and greater will be the number of resonating structure. For example, in propylene, there are three $\mathrm{H}-\mathrm{C}$ sigma bonds in conjugation with the $\pi$ bond. So, three resonating forms can be written for propylene.\\
\includegraphics[max width=\textwidth, center]{2025_01_28_8470952b98110cec3aabg-081(1)}

In 1-butene, there are two $\alpha \mathrm{C}-\mathrm{H}$ bonds in conjugation with double bond ( $\pi$-electrons), So, only two canonical forms can be written.\\

\section*{Effects of hyperconjugation:}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Stability of carbocations : The order of stability of carbocations is as follows.
\end{enumerate}

$$
\left(\mathrm{CH}_{3}\right)_{3} \mathrm{C}^{+}>\left(\mathrm{CH}_{3}\right)_{2} \mathrm{CH}^{+}>\mathrm{CH}_{3} \mathrm{CH}_{2}^{+}
$$

The above order of stability can be explained by hyperconjugation. In general greater the number of hydrogen atoms attached to $\alpha$-carbon atoms, the more hyperconjugative forms can be written and thus greater will be the stability of carbocation.\\
\includegraphics[max width=\textwidth, center]{2025_01_28_8470952b98110cec3aabg-082(1)}\\
2. Stability of free radicals: Stability of free radicals can also be explained as that of carbocations.

$$
\left(\mathrm{CH}_{3}\right)_{3} \dot{\mathrm{C}}>\left(\mathrm{CH}_{3}\right)_{2} \dot{\mathrm{C}} \mathrm{H}>\mathrm{CH}_{3} \dot{\mathrm{C}} \mathrm{H}_{2}>\dot{\mathrm{C}} \mathrm{H}_{3}
$$

\begin{enumerate}
  \setcounter{enumi}{2}
  \item Bond lengths: The bond length in a molecule changes if there is hyperconjugation, for example, in propene $\stackrel{3}{\mathbf{C}} \mathrm{H}_{3}-\stackrel{2}{\mathbf{C}} \mathrm{H}=\stackrel{1}{\mathbf{C}} \mathrm{H}_{2}$, the $\mathrm{C}_{1}-\mathrm{C}_{2}$ bond length is found to be more than $1.34 \AA$ while the $\mathrm{C}_{2}-\mathrm{C}_{3}$ bond distance is less than $1.54 \AA$ ( $\mathrm{C}-\mathrm{C}$ single bond length).
  \item Dipole moment: Since hyperconjugation causes the development of charges, it also affects the dipole moment of the molecule.
  \item Orienting influence of methyl group: The $o, p$-directing influence of the methyl group in methylbenzenes is attributed partly to inductive and partly to hyperconjugation effect.\\
\includegraphics{smile-56574873ad255570d026c0052d98eb8292e9caf2}\\
\includegraphics[max width=\textwidth, center]{2025_01_28_8470952b98110cec3aabg-082}
\end{enumerate}

The role of hyper conjugation in $0, p$ directing influence of methyl group is evidenced by the fact that nitration of $p$ isopropyl toluene and p-tert-butyl toluene give products in which- $\mathrm{NO}_{2}$ group is introduced in the ortho position with respect to methyl group and not to isopropyl or $t$-butyl group although the latter groups are more electron donating than the methyl group i.e. the substitution takes place contrary to inductive effect. Actually ihis constitutes an example where hyperconjugation overpowers inductive effect.\\

\section*{6. Stability of alkenes :}
(a) Greater the number of $\alpha \mathrm{C}-\mathrm{H}$ bonds in an alkene, greater will be the number of hyperconjugated structures, hence greater will be the stability. For instance, propene is more stable than ethene.\\

(b) Alkylated alkenes are more stable than others. Greater the alkylation of an alkene [greater the number of alkyl groups in an alkene] greater is its stability. Thus, the stability order is :\\

Reverse hyperconjugation : The phenomenon of hyperconjugation is also observed in the system given below:\\
\includegraphics[max width=\textwidth, center]{2025_01_28_8470952b98110cec3aabg-083(3)}

In such system the effect operates in the reverse direction. Hence the hyperconjugation in such system is known as reverse hyperconjugation.\\
\includegraphics[max width=\textwidth, center]{2025_01_28_8470952b98110cec3aabg-083(1)}

The meta directing influence and deactivating effect of $\mathrm{CX}_{3}$ group for electrophilic aromatic substitution reaction can be explained by this effect.\\

\section*{REACIIVEINTERMEDIATES}
A great majority of organic reactions are multistep processes involving intermediates whose life time is usually very short. An understanding of the structures and properties of these intermediates which are normal covalent compounds, ions or radicals is of paramount importance to an understanding of organic reaction mechanisms. Intermediates possess sufficiently low energy to be formed under the reaction conditions, but in most of the cases are not stable enough to permit isolation. This is especially true of those intermediates in which carbon has fewer than four covalent bonds. Common intermediates are

\begin{enumerate}

2. Carbocations: Carbocations are the key intermediates in several reactions and particularly in nucleophilic substitution reactions.\\
Structure: Generally, in the carbocations the positively charged carbon atom is bonded to three atoms and has no lone pair on carbon. Carbon has six valence electrons. It is $s p^{2}$ hybridized with a planar structure and bond angles of about $120^{\circ}$.\\
\includegraphics[max width=\textwidth, center]{2025_01_28_8470952b98110cec3aabg-085(1)}

Orbital picture of carbocation\\
There is a vacant unhybridized $p$ orbital which e.g., in the case of $\stackrel{+}{\mathrm{C}} \mathrm{H}_{3}$ lies perpendicular to the $s p^{2}$ hybridised plane..\\
Formation : Carbocations can be generated in a variety of ways. Some of the reactions in which carbocations are formed are summarized below.

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Solvolyis of $\mathrm{C}-\mathrm{X}$ bond ( $\mathrm{X}=$ halogens, etc.]
\end{enumerate}

$$
\mathrm{R}-\mathrm{X} \longrightarrow \mathrm{R}^{\oplus}+\mathrm{X}^{-}
$$

\begin{enumerate}
  \setcounter{enumi}{1}
  \item Deamination of amines by nitrous acid.
\end{enumerate}

$$
\mathrm{R}-\mathrm{NH}_{2} \xrightarrow{\mathrm{HNO}_{2}} \mathrm{RN}_{2}^{\oplus} \longrightarrow \mathrm{R}^{\oplus}+\mathrm{N}_{2}
$$

\begin{enumerate}
  \setcounter{enumi}{2}
  \item Protonation of alcohols followed by dehydration
\end{enumerate}

$$
\mathrm{R}-\mathrm{OH} \xrightarrow{\mathrm{H}^{\oplus}} \mathrm{R} \stackrel{\oplus}{\mathrm{O}} \mathrm{H}_{2} \longrightarrow \mathrm{R}^{\oplus}+\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}
$$

Stability: There is strong evidence, both physical and chemical, that alkyl groups are more electron-donating than hydrogen. It therefore, follows that when these groups are attached to the electron-deficient carbon of the carbocation, they tend to release electrons and partially compensate for the electron-deficiency of the positive carbon. The positive charge thus gets dispersed over all the alkyl groups and this dispersal of charge increases the stability of the whole system. Accordingly, tertiary carbocations are more stable than secondary ones which in turn are stabler than primary carbocations.\\
\includegraphics{smile-70d344d3117f8d6dfa76f10fc38f58413ef26bc5}

The greater stability of alkyl substituted carbocations is sometimes partly ascribed to the phenomenon of hyperconjugation. According to this, the $\sigma$ electrons of an $\alpha \mathrm{C}-\mathrm{H}$ bond can be delocalized into the unfilled $p$ orbital of the positive carbon atom, thus spreading the charge over all such bonds. For an alkyl-substituted carbocation, several hyperconjugative resonance forms can be written, each having the same number of covalent bonds as the first structure.\\
\includegraphics[max width=\textwidth, center]{2025_01_28_8470952b98110cec3aabg-086(4)}

\section*{Primary carbocation}
In case of a secondary carbocation, more equivalent structures can be written than for a primary carbocation whereas still greater number of such structures can be written for a tertiary carbocation.\\

$$



Triphenyl carbocation is so stable that when triphenylmethyl bromide is placed in liquid sulphur dioxide (a solvent with which carbocation does not react), it is possible to determine it quantitatively by measuring the electrical conductivity of the solution.\\
\includegraphics[max width=\textwidth, center]{2025_01_28_8470952b98110cec3aabg-086}\\
\includegraphics[max width=\textwidth, center]{2025_01_28_8470952b98110cec3aabg-086(1)}

Steric effects also play key role in the ease of formation and stability of carbocations derived from highly substituted substrates. The stability of such carbocations is attributed to the steric relief. In substrates such as tri-isopropyl chloride, the three bulky isopropyl groups are pushed together due to $s p^{3}$ angle of $109.5^{\circ}$. This pushing together results in a strain called B strain (or back strain). When this ionizes, the angle expands from $109.5^{\circ}\left(s p^{3}\right)$ to $120^{\circ}$ ( $s p^{2}$ ) resulting in the relief of this strain due to increase in space between the alkyl groups.\\
\includegraphics[max width=\textwidth, center]{2025_01_28_8470952b98110cec3aabg-087}

Such a carbocation would resist addition of a nucleophile as it would result in the crowding of bulky groups together.\\

4. Carbenes: Carbenes can be defined as neutral, divalent carbon intermediates in which carbon is covalently bonded to two atoms and has two non-bonding orbitals containing two electrons. Theoretical considerations suggest that there are two possible kinds of carbenes, singlet and triplet carbenes. In the singlet state, a carbon atom is presumed to approximate $s p^{2}$ hybridization. Two of the three $s p^{2}$ hybrid orbitals are utilized in forming two covalent bonds whereas the third hybrid orbital contains the unshared pair of electrons. The unhybridized $p$ orbital remains vacant. Thus singlet carbene resembles a carbocation very closely. On the other hand, carbon atom of a triplet carbene (b) is sp hybridized and it is a linear or near-linear species. The two hybrid orbitals are involved in the bond formation with two groups and the iwo electrons are placed one each, in the equivalent, mutually perpendicular $p_{y}$ and $p_{z}$ orbitals. Since these electrons have parallel spins, a carbene with this structure is said to be in a triplet state.\\
\includegraphics[max width=\textwidth, center]{2025_01_28_8470952b98110cec3aabg-089(1)}\\
(a) Singlet carbene\\
(b) Triplet carbene

At first sight, it appears that a singlet carbene has lower energy as the unshared electron pair is in a $s p^{2}$ hybrid orbital ;but the considerations of the electron repulsion energy that must be overcome to pair twoelectrons in a single orbital places it at the higher energy level than a triplet structure. It is, therefore, reasonable to believe that the triplet state of a carbene is more stable than the singlet state and should be expected to be the ground state.\\
Formation : Photochemical or thermal cleavage of cyclopropanes and oxiranes is a common method for the generation of carbenes.\\

6. Arynes : Arynes may be defined as aromatic compounds containing a formal carbon-carbon triple bond. The best known aryne is benzyne which may be regarded as the aromatic counterpart of acetylene or in other words, it is benzene minus two ortho hydrogens and can also be called as dehydrobenzene.\\
\includegraphics{smile-d46a3e7f5ea7ac85eea26c943a7fca2c9d286b1d}

The benzyne bond is not like the triple bond of acetylene where the two carbons form a $\sigma$ bond using sp orbitals and the remaining $p$ orbitals are used to form $\pi$ bonds. Such a structure is not possible in benzyne because of the hexagonal geometry associated with the benzene ring. Most probably the new bond of benzyne is formed by the overlap of $s p^{2}$ orbitals belonging to two neighbouring carbon atoms. These $s p^{2}$ orbitals are orthogonal to the $\pi$ molecular orbital of the benzene ring.

Formation: Benzyne bas been shown to be intermediate in several important organic reactions. For example, in the presence of a strong base, aryl halides eliminate HX from 1. 2 -positions to produce benzyne which then rapidly reacts with the available nucleophile to regenerate the aromatic system.\\

Chlorination of methane : The chlorination of methane in presence of ultraviolet light is an example of free radical substitution reaction.\\
\includegraphics[max width=\textwidth, center]{2025_01_28_8470952b98110cec3aabg-091(1)}

Methane Methyl chloride\\
The reaction does not stop with the formation of methyl chloride $\left(\mathrm{CH}_{3} \mathrm{Cl}\right)$ but the remaining hydrogen atoms are replaced one by one with chlorine atoms forming carbon tetrachloride as the final product.

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \mathrm{CH}_{3} \mathrm{Cl}+\mathrm{Cl}_{2} \longrightarrow \mathrm{CH}_{2} \mathrm{Cl}_{2}+\mathrm{HCl} \\
& \mathrm{CH}_{2} \mathrm{Cl}_{2}+\mathrm{Cl}_{2} \longrightarrow \mathrm{CHCl}_{3}+\mathrm{HCl} \\
& \mathrm{CHCl}_{3}+\mathrm{Cl}_{2} \longrightarrow \mathrm{CCl}_{4}+\mathrm{HCl}
\end{aligned}
$$

Mechanism : The reaction is initiated by the breaking of chlorine molecule into chlorine free radicals in presence of UV light.

\section*{I Step : Chain initiation : $\mathrm{Cl}_{2} \xrightarrow[\text { light }]{\mathrm{uv}} \mathrm{Cl}^{*}+\mathrm{Cl}^{\bullet}$}
II Step : Chain propagation : The chlorine free radicals attack methane molecule.

$$
\mathrm{CH}_{4}+\mathrm{Cl}^{\bullet} \longrightarrow \dot{\mathrm{C}} \mathrm{H}_{3}+\mathrm{HCl}
$$

Each of the methyl free radicals, in turn, reacts with chlorine molecule to form methyl chloride and at the same time\\
\includegraphics[max width=\textwidth, center]{2025_01_28_8470952b98110cec3aabg-091}\\
III Step : Chain termination : The chain of reactions initiated and propagated as shown above may be terminated if free radicals combine amongst themselves without giving rise to any new radicals.

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \dot{\mathrm{C} 1}+\dot{\mathrm{Cl}} \longrightarrow \mathrm{Cl}_{2} \\
& \dot{\mathrm{C}} \mathrm{H}_{3}+\dot{\mathrm{C}} \mathrm{l} \longrightarrow \mathrm{CH}_{3} \mathrm{Cl} \\
& \dot{\mathrm{C}} \mathrm{H}_{3}+\dot{\mathrm{C}} \mathrm{H}_{3} \longrightarrow \mathrm{CH}_{3}-\mathrm{CH}_{3}
\end{aligned}
$$

Reactivity of the halogen for free radical substitution is in the order:

$$
\mathrm{F}_{2}>\mathrm{Cl}_{2}>\mathrm{Br}_{2}>\mathrm{I}_{2}
$$

(b) Nucleophilic substitution:

Many substitution reactions, especially at the saturated carbon atom in aliphatic compounds such as alkyl halides, are brought about by nucleophilic reagent or nucleophiles.

$$
\underset{\text { Substrate }}{\mathrm{R}-\mathrm{X}}+\underset{\text { Natcophtile }}{\mathrm{OH}^{-}} \longrightarrow \underset{\text { Leaving group }}{ }
$$

Such substitution reactions are called nucleophilic substitution reactions, i.e., $\mathrm{S}_{\mathrm{N}}$ reactions ( S stands for substitution and $N$ for nucleophile). The nucleophilic substitution reactions are divided into two types:\\
(i) $\mathrm{S}_{\mathrm{N}} 2$ Reactions : These are bimolecular reactions. When the rate of reaction depends on the concentration of both substrate and the nucleophile, the reaction is said to be $\mathrm{S}_{\mathrm{N}} 2$, i.e., 2nd order change.

$$
\text { Rate } \propto \text { [Sustrate] [Nucleophile] }
$$

Hydrolysis of methyl chloride is an example of $\mathrm{S}_{\mathrm{N}} 2$ reaction\\
When the methyl chloride is attacked by $\mathrm{OH}^{-}$(a strong nucleophile) from the opposite side of the chlorine atom, a transition state (TS) results in which both OH and Cl are partially bonded to carbon atom.\\
\includegraphics[max width=\textwidth, center]{2025_01_28_8470952b98110cec3aabg-091(2)}

When (-)2-bromobutane is allowed to react with sodium hydroxide under conditions where second order kinetics is followed, (+)-2-butanol is formed.\\
\includegraphics[max width=\textwidth, center]{2025_01_28_8470952b98110cec3aabg-092(4)}

Configuration : Hence, an $\mathrm{S}_{\mathrm{N}} 2$ reaction proceeds with complete stereochemical inversion. This is also known as Walden inversion.\\
$\mathrm{S}_{\mathrm{N}} 2$ order : Methyl > ethyl > isopropyl > tertiary butyl > allyl > benzyl halides\\
(ii) $\mathrm{S}_{\mathrm{N}} 1$ Reactions : $\mathrm{S}_{\mathrm{N}} 1$ stands for unimolecular reaction. When the rate of nucleophilic substitution reaction depends only on the concentration of the substrate, the reaction is of first order change and is represented as $\mathrm{S}_{\mathrm{N}} 1$.

$$
\text { Rate } \propto \text { [Substrate] }
$$

The hydrolysis of tert-butyl bromide is an example of $\mathrm{S}_{\mathrm{N}} 1$ reaction. The reaction consists of two steps :\\
Step 1. The substrate undergoes heterolytic fission forming a carbocation. This is slow and hence rate determining step.\\
\includegraphics[max width=\textwidth, center]{2025_01_28_8470952b98110cec3aabg-092}

The carbocation is planar as the central positively charged carbon atom is $s p^{2}-$ hybridized.\\
Step 2. The nucleophile $\left(\mathrm{OH}^{-}\right)$can attack the planar carbocation form either side to form tert-butyl alcohol, low concentration of $\mathrm{OH}^{-}$favours $\mathrm{S}_{\mathrm{N}} 1$ reaction.\\
\includegraphics[max width=\textwidth, center]{2025_01_28_8470952b98110cec3aabg-092(2)}

Sometimes the carbocation formed (in step I) can undergo rearrangement to give more stable carbocation.

Step 1.\\
\includegraphics[max width=\textwidth, center]{2025_01_28_8470952b98110cec3aabg-092(3)}

Step 2.\\
\includegraphics[max width=\textwidth, center]{2025_01_28_8470952b98110cec3aabg-092(1)}

An $\mathrm{S}_{\mathrm{N}} 1$ reaction, leads to racemization and inversion.

For example, when (-) 2-bromobutane having chiral centre is treated with low concentration of nucleophile $\left(\mathrm{OH}^{-}\right)$, it forms (+)-2-butanol: There is also loss in optical activity due to formation of d -and $\ell$-isomer (racemic) because of $S_{N} 1$ reaction.\\
In another example of 1-bromo-1-phenylethane $\left[\mathrm{C}_{6} \mathrm{H}_{5} \mathrm{CH}(\mathrm{Br}) \mathrm{CH}_{3}\right]$, the $\mathrm{S}_{\mathrm{N}} 1$ reaction involves racemization plus inversion.\\

(b) Retention

\section*{Enantiomers}
The nucleophilic reagent attacks both (a) the back side and (b) the front side of the carbocation. Back side attack (a) predominates. Mixture of two enantiomers is equal amount constitutes the racemic modification.\\
Thus, in $\mathrm{S}_{\mathrm{N}} 1$ reaction, racemization as well as inversion is observed, while in case of $\mathrm{S}_{\mathrm{N}} 2$ complete inversion takes place (where chiral carbon exists). $\mathrm{S}_{\mathrm{N}} 1$ reaction is favoured by heavy (bulky) groups on the carbon atom attached to halogens; i.e.,\\
\includegraphics[max width=\textwidth, center]{2025_01_28_8470952b98110cec3aabg-093}\\
(c) Electrophilic substitution:

Electrophilic substitution involves the attack by an electrophile. It is represented as $\mathrm{S}_{\mathrm{E}}$ ( S stands for substitution and\\
$E$ stands for electrophile). If the order of reaction is 1 , it is written as $\mathrm{S}_{\mathrm{E}} 1$ (unimolecular) and if the order is 2 , it is $\mathrm{S}_{\mathrm{E}} 2$ (bimolecular).\\
(l) $\mathrm{S}_{\mathbf{E}} 1$ Reaction mechanism :

Electrophilic substitution in aliphatic compounds ( $\mathrm{S}_{\mathrm{E}} 1$ ) are very rare, some of the important examples are:\\
(a) Replacement of the metal atom in an organometallic compound by hydrogen

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \mathrm{R}-\mathrm{M}+\mathrm{H}^{+} \longrightarrow \mathrm{R}-\mathrm{H}+\mathrm{M}^{+} \\
& \mathrm{CH}_{3} \mathrm{CH}_{2} \mathrm{Na}+\mathrm{C}_{6} \mathrm{H}_{6} \longrightarrow \mathrm{CH}_{3}-\mathrm{CH}_{3}+\mathrm{C}_{6} \mathrm{H}_{5} \mathrm{Na}
\end{aligned}
$$

(b) Isotopic exchange of hydrogen for deuterium or tritium

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \mathrm{R}-\mathrm{H}+\mathrm{D}^{+} \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{R}-\mathrm{D}+\mathrm{H}^{+} \\
& \mathrm{R}-\mathrm{H}+\mathrm{T}^{+} \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{R}-\mathrm{T}+\mathrm{H}^{+}
\end{aligned}
$$

(II) $\mathrm{S}_{\mathrm{E}}{ }^{2}$ Reaction mechanism :

Electrophilic substitution ( $\mathrm{S}_{\mathrm{E}} 2$ ) is very common in benzene nucleus (aromatic compounds) in which $\pi$-electrons are highly delocalized and an electrophile can attack the region of high electron density. Aromatic electrophilic aromatic substitution reactions involve following steps :\\
Step 1. The formation of an electrophile, $\mathrm{E}^{+}$, i.e.,

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \mathrm{E}-\mathrm{Nu} \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{E}^{\oplus}+\mathrm{Nu}^{\ominus} \\
& \mathrm{E}^{\oplus}=\mathrm{Cl}^{\oplus}, \mathrm{NO}_{2}^{\oplus}, \mathrm{SO}_{3}^{\oplus}, \mathrm{R}^{\oplus}, \mathrm{RCO}
\end{aligned}
$$

Step 2. The electrophile attacks the aromatic ring to form carbocation (or arenium ion) which is stabilized by resonance.\\
\includegraphics[max width=\textwidth, center]{2025_01_28_8470952b98110cec3aabg-094(4)}

Step 3. Carbocation loses the proton to form substitution product.\\
\includegraphics[max width=\textwidth, center]{2025_01_28_8470952b98110cec3aabg-094(3)}

Ex. Bromination of benzene in presence of $\mathrm{FeBr}_{3}$ is an example of electrophilic substitution.\\
\includegraphics[max width=\textwidth, center]{2025_01_28_8470952b98110cec3aabg-094(1)}

\section*{Mechanism :}
Step 1. Formation of electrophile.

$$
\mathrm{Br}-\mathrm{Br}+\mathrm{FeBr}_{3} \longrightarrow \mathrm{Br}^{+}+\mathrm{FeBr}_{4}^{-}
$$

Step 2. The electrophile $\left(\mathrm{Br}^{+}\right)$attacks benzene ring to form a resonance stabilized carbocation.\\
\includegraphics[max width=\textwidth, center]{2025_01_28_8470952b98110cec3aabg-094(5)}

Step 3. Elimination of proton occurs and substitution product is formed.\\
\includegraphics[max width=\textwidth, center]{2025_01_28_8470952b98110cec3aabg-094}

Similarly, nitration, sulphonation and Friedel-Craft, reaction in benzene nucleus are other examples of electrophilic substitution.\\
2. Addition reactions : Addition reactions are those in which the attacking reagent adds on the substrate molecule without elimination. Such reactions are given by those compounds which possess double or triple bonds. In the process, a triple bond may be converted into double bond or single bonds and a double bond is converted into single bond. For each $\pi$-bond of the molecule two sigma bonds are formed and the hybridisation state of carbon atoms changes from $s p$ to $s p^{2}$ and $s p^{2}$ to $s p^{3}$.\\
Like substitution reactions, addition reaction are also of three types:\\
(a) Free radical addition reactions. (b) Nucleophilic addition reactions (c) Electrophilic addition reactions.

Some of the examples of addition reactions are:\\
(i)\\
\includegraphics[max width=\textwidth, center]{2025_01_28_8470952b98110cec3aabg-094(2)}\\

Mechanism of addition reaction : The addition reactions are the reactions of the double or triple bonds. These reactions may be initiated by electrophiles, nucleophiles or free radicals. The molecules having $>\mathrm{C}=\mathrm{C}<\mathrm{or}-\mathrm{C} \equiv \mathrm{C}-$ are readily attacked by electrophilic reagents, while molecules having $>\mathrm{C}=\mathrm{O}$ or $-\mathrm{C} \equiv$ N are readily attacked by nuçleophilic reagents.\\
(a) Electrophilic addition reactions: The reaction proceeds in two steps.\\
(i) Formation of carbocation (more stable), and (ii) attack of nucleophile on the carbocation to form addition product.\\

The addition of HBr on ethylene (a symmetrical olefin) is an example of electrophilic addition.\\
Step 1. Hydrogen bromide gives a proton and bromide ion.

$$
\mathrm{HBr} \underset{\text { Electrophile }}{\longrightarrow} \mathrm{H}^{+}+\underset{\text { Nusleophile }}{: \mathrm{Br}^{-}}
$$

Step 2. The electrophile attacks the double bond to form a carbocation. $\qquad$\\
\includegraphics[max width=\textwidth, center]{2025_01_28_8470952b98110cec3aabg-095(2)}

Step 3. The nucleophile ( $\mathrm{Br}^{-}$ion) now attacks the carbocation to form the addition product.\\
\includegraphics[max width=\textwidth, center]{2025_01_28_8470952b98110cec3aabg-095(6)}

In case both alkene and the adding reagent are unsymmetrical, two products are expected.\\
\includegraphics[max width=\textwidth, center]{2025_01_28_8470952b98110cec3aabg-096(4)}

Experimentally, it is observed that isopropyl bromide is the major product. This can be explained on the basis of following mechanism.\\
Step 1. Hydrogen bromide gives a proton $\left(\mathrm{H}^{+}\right)$and a bromide ion $\left(\mathrm{Br}^{-}\right)$.

$$
\mathrm{HBr} \longrightarrow \mathrm{H}^{+}+: \mathrm{Br}^{-}
$$

Step 2. The proton $\left(\mathbf{H}^{+}\right)$attacks the $\pi$-bond to give a stable carbocation.\\
\includegraphics[max width=\textwidth, center]{2025_01_28_8470952b98110cec3aabg-096(3)}

Step 3. The nucleophile (bromideion) attacks the more stable carbocation to give isopropyl bromide (major product).\\
\includegraphics[max width=\textwidth, center]{2025_01_28_8470952b98110cec3aabg-096}

Addition reactions in alkadienes : Conjugated alkadienes (1,3-butadiene) reacts with halogens halogen acids, hydrogen and water, etc. to yield a mixture of 1,2, and 1,4-addition products.\\
Some of the important examples are :\\
(i) Addition of halogens:\\
\includegraphics[max width=\textwidth, center]{2025_01_28_8470952b98110cec3aabg-097(4)}\\
(ii) Addition of halogen acids $(\mathrm{HBr}$ or HCl$)$ :\\
\includegraphics[max width=\textwidth, center]{2025_01_28_8470952b98110cec3aabg-097(2)}\\
(b) Nucleophilic addition reactions: When the addition reaction occurs on account of the initial attack of nucleophile, the reaction is said to be a nucleophilic addition reaction. Due to presence of strongly electronegative oxygen atom, the $\pi-$ electrons of the carbon-oxygen double bond in carbonyl group ( $>\mathrm{C}=\mathrm{O}$ ) get shifted towards the oxygen atom and thereby such bond is highly polarised. This makes carbon atom of the carbonyl group electron deficient.\\
\includegraphics[max width=\textwidth, center]{2025_01_28_8470952b98110cec3aabg-097(1)}\\
\includegraphics[max width=\textwidth, center]{2025_01_28_8470952b98110cec3aabg-097(3)}\\
(Less stable)\\
The addition of HCN to acetone ( $>\mathrm{C}=\mathrm{O}$ compounds) is an example of nucleophilic addition.\\
\includegraphics[max width=\textwidth, center]{2025_01_28_8470952b98110cec3aabg-097}

The mechanism of the reaction involves the following steps :\\
Step 1. HCN gives a proton $\left(\mathrm{H}^{+}\right)$and nucleophile, a cyanide ion ( $\mathrm{CN}-$ ).\\
$\mathrm{HCN} \longrightarrow \mathrm{H}^{+}+\mathrm{CN}^{-}$\\
Step 2. The nucleophile ( $\mathrm{CN}{ }^{-}$) attacks the positively charged carbon as to form an anion $\left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right.$does not attack the negatively charged oxygen as anion is more stable than cation].\\
\includegraphics[max width=\textwidth, center]{2025_01_28_8470952b98110cec3aabg-098(5)}

Step 3. The proton $\left(\mathrm{H}^{+}\right)$combines with anion to form the addition product.\\
\includegraphics[max width=\textwidth, center]{2025_01_28_8470952b98110cec3aabg-098(4)}

Other examples of nucleophilic addition reaction are:\\
Addition of Grignard reagent to $>\mathrm{C}=\mathrm{O}$ compounds :\\
\includegraphics[max width=\textwidth, center]{2025_01_28_8470952b98110cec3aabg-098(2)}\\
(c) Free radical addition reactioms:\\
(i) This type of addition reaction takes place in vapour phase or in non-polar solvents (i.e., $\mathrm{Cl}_{2}, \mathrm{Br}_{2}, \mathrm{H}_{2}, \mathrm{CO}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{CH}_{4}$ etc.) in presence of sunlight. For example, the photochemically catalysed addition of chlorine to ethylene.

$$
\underset{\text { Ethylene }}{\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{C}=\mathrm{CH}_{2}}+\underset{\text { (gas) }}{\mathrm{Cl}_{2}} \xrightarrow[\text { (light) }]{\text { hivorheat }} \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{C}-\mathrm{Cl}_{2}
$$

(ii) The rate determining step suggests for addition of free radicals.

Addition of HBr on unsymmetric alkene in presence of peroxide is also an example of free radical addition reaction.

\section*{3. Elimination reactions}
The reverse of addition reactions are termed as elimination reactions. In these reactions generally atoms or groups from two adjacent carbon atoms in the substrate molecule are removed and a multiple bond is formed. In the process, two sigma bonds are lost and a new $\pi$-bond is formed, i.e., state of hybridization of carbon atom changes from $s p^{3}$ and $s p^{2}$ to $s p$.

Some example are:\\
\includegraphics[max width=\textwidth, center]{2025_01_28_8470952b98110cec3aabg-099(3)}\\

Mechanism of elimination reactions : An elimination reaction, generally, involves loss of atoms or groups from adjacent carbon atoms resulting in the formation of a $\pi$-bond between the carbon atoms, so these are reverse to addition reactions. The elimination reactions are divided into two classes :\\
(I) $\mathrm{E}_{2}$ reactions. $\mathrm{E}_{2}$ stands for bimolecular elimination. (II) $\mathrm{E}_{1}$ reactions. $\mathrm{E}_{1}$ stands for unimolecular elimination.\\
(d) $\mathbf{E}_{2}$ reactions : The dehydrohalogenation of the alkyl halides with alcoholic alkali is an example of this type. It occurs in one step.

$$
\mathrm{CH}_{3} \mathrm{CH}_{2} \mathrm{CH}_{2} \mathrm{Br}+\mathrm{C}_{2} \mathrm{H}_{5} \overline{\mathrm{O}} \rightarrow \mathrm{CH}_{3} \mathrm{CH}=\mathrm{CH}_{2}+\mathrm{Br}^{-}+\mathrm{C}_{2} \mathrm{H}_{5} \mathrm{OH}

Dehydration of alcohol is another example of elimination reaction. When acids like conc. $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{SO}_{4}$ or $\mathrm{H}_{3} \mathrm{PO}_{4}$ are used as dehydrating agents, the mechanism is $\mathrm{E}_{1}$. The proton given by acid is taken up by alcohol.\\

Carbocation\\
The carbocation loses a proton to form alkene.\\
4. Rearrangement reactions:

The reactions which involve the migration of an atom or group from one site to another within the molecule (nothing is added from outside and nothing is eliminated) resulting in a new molecular structure are known as rearrangement reactions. The new compound is actually the structural isomer of the original one.\\

\section*{PURIFICATION OF ORGANIC COMPOUNDS :}
For characterization and determination of the structural formulae of an organic compound it is essential that it should be in the purest form. Methods usually adopted for the purification of organic compounds are:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Crystallization: This is a process used for obtaining a compound in pure solid form often of well-defined geometrically shaped crystals. The method is based on the difference in solubility of the organic compound and the impurities present in it. A safurated solution of the impure compound in a suitable solvent is prepared. Of course the temperature has to be increased for more dissolution of the organic compound. Subsequently the solution is filtered and cooled, pure crystals get separated.\\
Solvent chosen must have the following properties :\\
(i) It should not react chemically with the compound to be purified\\
(ii) It should not dissolve the impurities at all or dissolve to a limited extent so that they remain in the mother liquor\\
(iii) The solubility of the compound in the solvent at room temperature should be low, whereas at elevated temperature the solubility should be high.\\
Solvents: Water, ethanol, dioxane, acetone, benzene, chloroform, petroleum ether etc.
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Ex. Compound and impurity}
Benzoic acid + naphthalene\\
Sugar + sand\\
Sugar + common salt\\
Iodoform + impurity

\section*{Solvent chosen}
Water\\

Ethanol\\
Ethanol

Fractional crystallization : Separation of different compounds of a mixture by repeated crystallization is called fractional crystallization. A hot saturated solution containing two substances is cooled, the component with lower solubility crystallizes out first and these crystals can then be separated out by filtration. The more soluble component crystallizes out on further cooling.\\
Ex. $\left[\mathrm{KClO}_{3}+\mathrm{KCl}\right]$ mixture can be separated by fractional crystallisation. $\mathrm{KClO}_{3}$ crystallized first being less soluble. After the separation of $\mathrm{KClO}_{3}, \mathrm{KCl}$ will be crystallized subsequently being more soluble.\\
2. Sublimation : In the sublimation process, solid directly transforms into vapour state on heating and the vapours on cooling transform directly into solid state. This method is used for the purification of solids which sublime from the non-volatile impurities.\\
heating

\section*{Solid $\rightleftharpoons$ Vapour \\
 Cooling}
Ex. Camphor, naphthalene, ammonium chloride, salicyclic acid, iodine, $\mathrm{AlCl}_{3}, \mathrm{HgCl}_{2}$ etc, are purified by sublimation.\\
3. Distillation : Distillation is used for separating the constituents of a liquid mixture which differ in their boiling points.\\
(a) Simple distillation: Distillation implies conversion of liquid into vapour state by heating followed by condensation of the vapours by ceoling. (The non-volatile impurities are left in the flask itself). The method is suited for liquids which are stable at tneir boiling point.\\
Ex. Ethanol, benzene, chloroform, carbon tetrachloride, toluene, xylene, nitrobenzene, chlorobenzene etc.\\
A mixture of two liquids can be separated by simple distillation provided their boiling points differ by a wide range.\\
(i) Mixture of hexane (b.p. 342 K ) and toluene (b.p. 384 K )\\
(ii) Mixture of benzene (b.p. 353 K ) and aniline (b.p. 457 K )\\
(b) Fractional distillation : Fractional distillation is a suitable process for separating two or more miscible liquids which have boiling points quite close to each other.\\
Ex. (i) Mixture of acetone (b.p. 330 K ) and methyl alcohol (b.p. 338 K ). (ii) Separation of petroleum into gasoline, kerosene oil, diesel oil etc.\\
Distillation assembly is provided with fractionating column. The fractionating column is a long tube provided with obstructions to the passage of the vapours moving upwards and liquids moving downwards. It should be kept in mind that fractionating column increases the cooling surface.\\[0pt]
On heating the liquid in the distillation flask, vapours of more volatile liquid rise up in the fractionating column and condense while passing through the condenser [cooled by circulating water] and is collected in the receiver. The vapours of less volatile liquid simultaneously rise in the column but due to several obstructions they get condensed in the column itself and flow back to the distillation flask. Obviously the receiver contains the fraction rich in more volatile liquid. On repeating the process separation of mixture of two liquids can be accomplished. Figure shows fractional distillation.\\
\includegraphics[max width=\textwidth, center]{2025_01_28_8470952b98110cec3aabg-103}\\
(c) Distillation under reduced pressure (vacuum distillation): Vacuum distillation is used for the distillation of those liquids which decompose before their boiling point is reached. Under reduced pressure the liquid will be boiled at lower temperature (without decomposition) and so its distillation can be carried out.\\
Ex. Fatty acids, glycerol etc.

\section*{(d) Steam distillation:}
Steam distillation is used to purify the substances (liquids or solids)\\
(a) which are volatile in steam, (b) immiscible with water (c) contaminated with non-volatile impurities\\
\includegraphics[max width=\textwidth, center]{2025_01_28_8470952b98110cec3aabg-104}

\section*{Steam distillation}
\section*{Ex. (i) Purification of aniline (ii) Separation of ortho and para nitrophenol.}
The proportion of the organic substance that distills over with steam is related to the vapour pressures as well as molecular masses. It is given by the following equation: $\frac{w_{1}}{w_{2}}=\frac{p_{1} M_{1}}{p_{2} M_{2}}$ where $w_{1}$ and $w_{2}$ are the masses of water and the compound (which is steam distilled) respectively, $p_{1}$ and $p_{2}$ are the vapour pressures of water and the compound respectively at the temperature of distillation, $M_{1}$ and $M_{2}$ are the molar masses of water and the compound respectively.\\
4. Differential extraction : In order to recover organic compounds from their aqueous solution, differential extraction method is prominently used. An aqueous solution of organic compound is taken in the separating funnel and is shaken with organic solvent which is immiscible with water but in which the organic compound is highly soluble. Organic compound is dissolved in the organic solvent which is extracted by the separating funnel. Organic compound is then recovered by evaporating the solvent in a water bath. The process is repeated to make further recovery of organic compound.\\
It should however be noted that with a given amount of the solvent, if more number of extractions are carried out with small amount of the solvent greater will be amount of the extracted substance.\\
Solvents : The solvents usually used in the extraction process are benzene, ether, chloroform, dioxane, acetone etc. Ex. To remove benzoic acid from aqueous solution of benzoic acid, benzene is used as the extracting solvent.\\
5. Chromatography : Chromatography is the most versatile analytical technique used for the separation, purification, isolation and identification of the constituents present in a mixture (coloured or colourless). It was discovered by Tswett (1906) for the separation of plant pigments.\\
Chromatography may be defined as the technique of separating the components of a mixture in which separation is affected by movement of individual components through a stationary phase (fixed) under the influence of mobile phase.\\
Different types of important chromatography are:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|}
\hline
\multicolumn{2}{|c|}{Nature of phase} & \multicolumn{1}{c|}{Type of chromatography} & \multicolumn{1}{c|}{Uses} \\

Gas & Liquid & \begin{tabular}{l}

\end{tabular} & Paper chromatography \\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

Adsorption or column chromatography : Sample containing various constituents is dissolved in a suitable solvent and the solution is allowed to percolate through a column (glass tube or burette containing silica gel). The solution moves down slowly and the various constituents of the mixture get adsorbed to different extent over the adsorbent.\\
The constituent which is adsorbed most strongly will be retained at top. The constituent which is adsorbed least strongly will be retained at the lower level.\\
The constituent which is adsorbed still less will be retained at the still lower level and so on.\\
Supposing there are three organic compounds A, B and C present in the mixture. The decreasing order of their adsorbing tendency is: $A>B>C$\\
Obviously A will be adsorbed near the top of the column while $C$ having least adsorbing tendency will be adsorbed in the last.\\
The columns will appear as coloured bands or zones of various constituents.\\
Further by the process of elution i.e. by percolating suitable solvent through the column, the least adsorbed constituent is eluted first while the strongly adsorbed constituent will be eluted afterwards. The pure compound is recovered by evaporation of the solvent.\\
Ex. Chlorophyll from plants, pigments or dyes etc.\\

\section*{QUALITATIVE ANAIYSIS}
The qualitative analysis of an organic compound involves the detection of all elements present in it.\\
Detection of carbon and hydrogen : A small amount of dry and powdered substance is mixed with about double amount of pure and dry copper oxide. The mixture is heated in a dried hard glass tube fitted with a delivery tube carrying a bulb in the horizontal length The bulb of delivery tube contains anhydrous copper sulphate (white). When the mixture is heated, carbon present in the compound is oxidised to carbon dioxide which turns lime water milky, while hydrogen present in the organic compound is oxidised to water which turns anhydrous copper sulphate in the bulb to blue.

This method is known as copper oxide test.\\
Detection of nitrogen : Nitrogen in an organic compound is detected by the following tests.\\
(a) Soda lime test. A pinch of an organic compound is heated strongly with soda lime $(\mathrm{NaOH}+\mathrm{CaO})$ in a test tube evolution of ammonia indicates nitrogen.\\
\includegraphics[max width=\textwidth, center]{2025_01_28_8470952b98110cec3aabg-106(2)}\\
acetamide\\
Limitation: This method has a limitation. A large number of organic compounds such as nitro and diazo compounds do not liberate ammonia on heating with sodalime.\\
(b) Lassaigne's method: A small piece of dry sodium is heated gently in an ignition tube till it melts to a shining globule. Then, a small amount of organic substance is plunged into distilled water contained in a porcelein dish added and the contents are heated first slowly and then strongly till it becomes red hot. The red hot tube is then cooled and contents are filtered. The filtered liquid is known as sodium extract or Lassaigne's extract.\\
The Lassaigne's extract is usually alkaline. If not, it may be made alkaline by adding a few drops of a dilute solution of sodium hydroxide. To a part of sodium extract, a small amount of freshly prepared ferrous sulphate solution is added and the contents are warmed. A few drops of ferric chloride solution are added. The appearance of a bluish green or a blue colouration, confirms the presence of nitrogen in the organic compound.\\
The following chemical reactions occur during the test :

$$
\mathrm{Na}+\mathrm{C}+\mathrm{N} \longrightarrow \mathrm{NaCN}
$$

In organic compound

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \begin{array}{l}
\mathrm{FeSO}_{4}+2 \mathrm{NaCN} \\
\mathrm{Fe}(\mathrm{CN})_{2}+4 \mathrm{NaCN} \\
\\
\text { sodium ferrocyanide }
\end{array} \longrightarrow{\mathrm{Fe}(\mathrm{CN})_{2}+\mathrm{Na}_{2} \mathrm{SO}_{4}}_{\longrightarrow}^{\longrightarrow} \mathrm{Na}_{4}\left[\mathrm{Fe}(\mathrm{CN})_{6}\right]
\end{aligned}
$$

When nitrogen and sulphur both are present in any organic compound, sodium thiocyanate is formed during fusion. When extracted with water sodium thiocyanate goes into the sodium extract and gives blood red colouration with ferric ions due to the formation of ferric thiocyanate\\

\section*{Detection of sulphur:}
Lassaigne's test : The sulphur in the compound reacts with sodium metal to form sodium sulphide.

$$
2 \mathrm{Na}+\mathrm{S} \longrightarrow \mathrm{Na}_{2} \mathrm{~S}
$$

The Lassaigne's extract is divided into three parts and following tests are performed.\\
(i) Sodium nitroprusside test. To one portion of the extract few drops of sodium nitroprusside are added. The appearance of violet colouration indicates sulphur.

$$
\begin{gathered}
\mathrm{Na}_{2} \mathrm{~S} \\
\text { sod. nitroprusside violet colouration }
\end{gathered} \mathrm{Na}_{2}\left[\mathrm{Fe}(\mathrm{CN})_{5} \mathrm{NO}\right] \longrightarrow \mathrm{Na}_{4}\left[\mathrm{Fe}(\mathrm{CN})_{5} \mathrm{NO} . \mathrm{S}\right]
$$

(ii) Lead acetate test : The second part of the Lassaigne's extract is acidified with acetic acid and then lead acetate solution is added. Formation of black precipitate confirms the presence of sulphur.

$$

$$

(iii) Silver nitrate test : The third part of Lassaigne's extract is acidified with acetic acid and then $\mathrm{AgNO}_{3}$ solution is added. Formation of black ppt. confirms the presence of sulphur.-

$$
\mathrm{Na}_{2} \mathrm{~S}+2 \mathrm{AgNO}_{3} \longrightarrow \underset{\text { Black }}{\longrightarrow} \mathrm{Ag}_{2} \mathrm{~S} \downarrow+2 \mathrm{NaNO}_{3}
$$

\section*{Detection of halogens:}
Beilstein test : A stout copper wire is heated in non-luminous flame till it ceases to impart green colour to the flame. Now the heated end of the wire is dipped into the organic compound and again taken to flame. Appearance of green or bluish green colour of the flame indicates the presence of halogens.\\
Urea, thiourea etc. also give this test due to the formation of volatile $\mathrm{Cu}(\mathrm{CN})_{2}$\\
Lassaigne's test. Sodium extract is prepared. During fusion, sodium will combine with the halogen (from the organic compound) to form sodium halide.

$$
\mathrm{Na}+\mathrm{X} \xrightarrow{\text { Fusion }} \mathrm{NaX}(\mathrm{X}=\mathrm{Cl}, \mathrm{Br}, \mathrm{I})
$$

Now, we add $\mathrm{AgNO}_{3}$ solution.\\
(i) If white precipitate appears then chlorine is confirmed.

$$
\mathrm{NaCl}+\mathrm{AgNO}_{3} \longrightarrow \underset{\text { white ppt. }}{\mathrm{AgCl} \downarrow+\mathrm{NaNO}_{3}}
$$

(ii) If light yellow precipitate appears then bromine is confirmed.

$$
\mathrm{NaBr}+\mathrm{AgNO}_{3} \longrightarrow \underset{\substack{ \\\text { light yellow ppt. }}}{\mathrm{AgBr} \downarrow}+\mathrm{NaNO}_{3}
$$

(iii) If dark yellow precipitate appears then iodine is confirmed.

$$
\mathrm{NaI}+\mathrm{AgNO}_{3} \longrightarrow \underset{\text { dark yellow ppt. }}{\mathrm{AgI} \downarrow}+\mathrm{NaNO}_{3}

The extract is boiled with conc. $\mathrm{HNO}_{3}$ and then ammonium molybdate solution is added. The appearance of yellow precipitate or colouration (due to formation of ammonium phosphomolybdate) shows the presence of phosphorus.

$$

\end{center}

Estimation of C and H [Liebig's method] : A known weight of organic compound is heated with cupric oxide in an atmosphere of air or oxygen (free from $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ ), C and H of organic compounds are oxidised to $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ respectively. The former is collected over KOH and latter is absorbed by $\mathrm{CaCl}_{2}$. From the amounts of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ vapours, percentage of C and H can be calculated.

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \mathrm{C}+2 \mathrm{CuO} \longrightarrow \\
& \text { In the compound }
\end{aligned} \mathrm{CO}_{2}+2 \mathrm{Cu} ; 2 \mathrm{H}+\mathrm{CuO} \longrightarrow \begin{aligned}
& \text { In the compound }
\end{aligned} \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}+\mathrm{Cu}
$$

$$
\% \text { of } \mathrm{C}=\frac{12}{44} \times \frac{\text { mass of } \mathrm{CO}_{2} \text { formed }}{\text { mass of organic compound taken }} \times 100
$$

$$
\% \text { of } \mathrm{H}=\frac{2}{18} \times \frac{\text { mass of } \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O} \text { formed }}{\text { mass of organic compound taken }} \times 100
$$

Estimation of nitrogen : There are two methods for the estimation of nitrogen.\\
(a) Duma's method\\
(b) Kjeldahl's method\\
(a) Duma's method : A known weight of organic compound is heated with cupric oxide in an atmosphere of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}, \mathrm{C}$ and H are oxidised to $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ respectively, while N is converted to $\mathrm{N}_{2}$. It is anticipated that some oxides of nitrogen may also be formed which is reduced to $\mathrm{N}_{2}$ by passing over heated copper gauze.

\begin{verbatim}
$\mathrm{C}+2 \mathrm{CuO} \longrightarrow \mathrm{CO}_{2}+2 \mathrm{Cu}$
$2 \mathrm{H}+\mathrm{CuO} \longrightarrow \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}+\mathrm{Cu}$
$2 \mathrm{~N}+\mathrm{CuO} \longrightarrow \quad \mathrm{N}_{2}+$ oxides of nitrogen
Oxides of nitrogen $+\mathrm{Cu} \longrightarrow \mathrm{CuO}+\mathrm{N}_{2}$
\end{verbatim}

The gaseous nitrogen is collected over conc. KOH solution (all other gases are absorbed except nitrogen) and its volume is measured at room temperature and atmospheric pressure. The volume of the nitrogen gas so obtained is converted into NTP and its mass is calculated.

$$
\% \text { of nitrogen }=\frac{28}{22400} \times \frac{\text { Volume of } \mathrm{N}_{2} \text { at NTP }}{\text { Mass of organic compound taken }} \times 100
$$

Volume of $\mathrm{N}_{2}$ at NTP can be calculated as :

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \frac{P_{1} V_{1}}{T_{1}}=\frac{P_{2} V_{2}}{T_{2}}(N T P) \\
& V_{2}=\frac{P_{1} V_{1} T_{2}}{P_{2} T_{1}}=\frac{(P-a) \times V_{1} \times 273}{760 \times(273+t)}
\end{aligned}
$$

Where: $\mathrm{V}_{1}=$ Volume of $\mathrm{N}_{2}$ at room temperature, $\mathrm{a}=$ Aqueous tension at $\mathrm{t}^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ ( mm of Hg )\\
$t^{\circ} \mathrm{C}=$ Room temperature, $\mathrm{V}_{2}=$ Volume of nitrogen at NTP, $\mathrm{P}=$ Atmospheric pressure\\
(b) Kjeldahi's method: Kjeldhal's method is a faster method than Dumas method. However, this method is used only for organic compounds which on heating strongly with concentrated sulphuric acid are converted quantitatively into ammonium sulphate.\\
Kjeldahl's method cannot be used for the organic compounds\\
(a) containing nitrogen in the ring, e.g., pyridine, quinoline etc.\\
(b) containing nitro $\left(-\mathrm{NO}_{2}\right)$ and diazo $(-\mathrm{N}=\mathrm{N}-)$ groups.

A known weight of organic compound is heated strongly with conc. $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{SO}_{4}\left[\mathrm{CuSO} \mathrm{C}_{4}\right.$ catalyst]. As a result, nitrogen in\\
the compound is converted quantitatively into ammonium sulphate. The solution is then treated with excess of NaOH . The ammonia gas evolved is passed into excess volume of HCl or $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{SO}_{4}$ solution of known strength. The acid left back is treated with standard alkali. From the acid consumed by ammonia. percentage of nitrogen can be calculated.

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \mathrm{C}+\mathrm{H}+\mathrm{N} \xrightarrow[\Delta]{\text { conc. } \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{SO}_{4}}\left(\mathrm{NH}_{4}\right)_{2} \mathrm{SO}_{4}+\mathrm{CO}_{2}+\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O} \\
& \left(\mathrm{NH}_{4}\right)_{2} \mathrm{SO}_{4}+2 \mathrm{NaOH} \longrightarrow \mathrm{Na}_{2} \mathrm{SO}_{4}+2 \mathrm{NH}_{3}+2 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O} \\
& 2 \mathrm{NH}_{3}+\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{SO}_{4} \longrightarrow\left(\mathrm{NH}_{4}\right)_{2} \mathrm{SO}_{4} \\
& \% \text { of nitrogen }=\frac{1.4 \times \text { Normality of the acid } \times \text { Volume of used acid }}{\text { Mass of organic compound taken }}=\frac{1.4 \times \mathrm{N} \times \mathrm{V}}{\mathrm{~W}}
\end{aligned}
$$

Estimation of halogens (Carius method) : The organic compound containing halogen is oxidised with fuming nitric acid in presence of $\mathrm{AgNO}_{3}$. The halogens are converted into silver halides The silver halides are washed, isolated and dried. The percentage of halogen can be calculated.

Estimation of sulphur : The organic compound containing sulphur is heated with fuming $\mathrm{HNO}_{3}$, when sulphur is oxidised to $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{SO}_{4}$. Precipitation of sulphate is carried out with barium chloride solution in the form of $\mathrm{BaSO}_{4}$. The precipitate is separated, washed and weighed.

\section*{Q Exmporad 15:}
0.244 g of an organic compound on combustion with dry oxygen produced 0.616 g of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ and 0.108 g of $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$. Determine the percentage composition of the compound.

Sol. Mass of the organic compound taken $=0.244 \mathrm{~g}$.\\
Mass of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ formed $=0.616 \mathrm{~g}$\\
Mass of $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ formed $=0.108 \mathrm{~g}$\\
We know that $\mathrm{CO}_{2} \equiv \mathrm{C}$ and $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O} \equiv 2 \mathrm{H}$

$$
44 \mathrm{~g} \quad 12 \mathrm{~g} \quad 18 \mathrm{~g} \quad 2 \mathrm{~g}
$$

(i) Mass of C in the $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ formed $=\frac{0.616 \times 12}{44} \mathrm{~g}$

Percentage of $C$ in the compound $=\frac{0.616 \times 12}{44} \times \frac{100}{0.244}=68.85$\\
(ii) Mass of H in the $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ formed $=\frac{0.108 \times 2}{18} \mathrm{~g}$

Percentage of H in the compound $=\frac{0.108 \times 2 \times 100}{18 \times 0.244}=4.92$\\
(iii) Percentage of $O$ in the compound $=100-(68.85+4.92)=26.23 \%$

The percentage composition of the compound is, $\mathrm{C}=68.85 \%, \mathrm{H}=4.92 \%$ and $\mathrm{O}=26.23 \%$.

\section*{[xamplazel 16 :}
0.196 g of an organic substance on combustion gave 0.22 g of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ and 0.0675 g of $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$. In Carius determination, 0.3925 g of the substance gave 0.717 g of dry AgCl . Find the percentage composition of the substance.

Sol. (a) Percentage of C and H\\
Mass of the substance taken for combustion $=0.196 \mathrm{~g}$\\
Mass of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ formed $=0.22 \mathrm{~g}$\\
Mass of $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ formed $=0.0675 \mathrm{~g}$\\
Percentage of C in the compound $=\frac{0.22 \times 12}{44 \times 0.196} \times 100=30.6$\\
Percentage of H in the compound $=\frac{0.0675 \times 2 \times 100}{18 \times 0.196}=3.8$\\
(b) Percentage of chlorine

Mass of substance taken for Carius determination $=0.3925 \mathrm{~g}$\\
Mass of AgCl formed $=0.717 \mathrm{~g}$\\
$\mathrm{AgCl}=\mathrm{Cl} \quad($ Molar mass of $\mathrm{AgCl}=108+35.5=143.5)$\\
143.5 g 35.5 g

So, Mass of chlorine in 0.717 g of $\mathrm{AgCl}=0.717 \mathrm{~g} \times \frac{35.5}{143.5}=0.1774 \mathrm{~g}$\\
Then, percentage of Cl in the sample $=\frac{0.1774 \times 100}{0.3925}=45.2$\\
Therefore, the percentage composition of the compound is, $\mathrm{C}=30.6 \%, \mathrm{H}=3.8 \%, \mathrm{Cl}=45.2 \%, \mathrm{O}$ (by difference) $20.4 \%$

\section*{CHIEMICAL METHODS FOR DEIERMINATION OF MOLECULAR MASS}
There are two methods for determination of molecular mass.\\
(i) Silver salt method (for organic acids)\\
(ii) Chloroplatinate salt method (for organic bases)\\
(i) Silver salt method : A known mass of the acid is dissolved in water followed by the subsequent addition of silver nitrate solution till the ppt of silver salt is complete. The ppt is separated, dried, weighed and ignited till decomposition is complete. The residue of pure silver left behind is weighed.

Organic acid $\xrightarrow{\mathrm{AgNO}_{3}}$ Silver salt $\xrightarrow{\text { combustion }} \mathrm{Ag}$\\
Let the mass of silver salt formed $=W \mathrm{gm}$\\
Mass of silver left behind $=\mathbf{w} \mathrm{gm}$\\
$\frac{\text { Mass of silver salt }}{\text { Mass of silver left behind }}=\frac{\text { Equivalent mass of silver salt }}{\text { Equivalent mass of silver }}$

$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{W}{w} & =\frac{E}{108} \\
E & =\frac{W}{W} \times 108
\end{aligned}
$$

Hence, equivalent mass of organic acid $=$ Equivalent mass of silver salt - Equivalent mass of $\mathrm{Ag}+$ Equivalent mass of H

$$
=E-108+1=E-107
$$

Molecular mass of organic acid $=$ Equivalent mass of acid $\times$ Basicity of acid

\section*{[xamplaty] 17 :}
0.41 g of silver salt of a dibasic organic acid left 0.216 g residue of silver on ignition. Calculate the molecular mass of the acid. (equivalent weight of silver $=108$ )\\
Sol. Mass of the silver salt taken $=0.41 \mathrm{~g}$\\
Mass of silver left behind $=0.216 \mathrm{~g}$

$$
\frac{\text { Mass of silver salt }}{\text { Mass of silver residue }}=\frac{\text { Equivalent mass of silver salt }}{\text { Equivalent mass of silver }}
$$

Equivalent mass of silver salt $=\frac{0.41 \times 108}{0.216}=205$\\
Equivalent mass of acid $=205-108+1=98$\\
Molar mass of acid $=$ Equivalent mass of acid $\times$ basicity of acid

$$
=98 \times 2=196
$$

(ii) Chloroplatinate salt method : This chemical method is used to find the molecular mass of organic bases. A known mass of organic base is allowed to react with chloroplatinic acid $\left(\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{PtCl}_{6}\right)$ to form insoluble chloroplatinate salt. The ppt of chloroplatinate salt is separated, dried, weighed and is subsequently ignited till decomposition is complete. The residue left is platinum which is again weighed. The molecular mass is then calculated by knowing the mass of chloroplatinate salt and that of platinum left. If $B$ represents the molecule of monoacid organic base, then the formula of chloroplatinate salt is $\mathrm{B}_{2} \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{Pt} \mathrm{Cl}_{6}$.\\
\includegraphics[max width=\textwidth, center]{2025_01_28_8470952b98110cec3aabg-111}

Mass of chlorplatinate salt $=\mathrm{Wg}$\\
Mass of platinum residue left $=\mathrm{wg}$\\
If eq. weight of organic base $=E$\\
Thus molecular mass of chloroplatinate salt $=2 \mathrm{E}+(2+195+35.5 \times 6)=2 \mathrm{E}+410$\\
1 mole of chloroplatinate salt (2E +410 ) on heating gives one atom of platinum (195).

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \frac{\text { Mass of chloro platinate }}{\text { Mass of platinum residue }}=\frac{\text { Molar mass of chloroplatinate salt }}{\text { Atomic weight of platinum }} \\
& \frac{W}{w}=\frac{2 E+410}{195} \\
& 2 E=\left(\frac{W}{w} \times 195\right)-410 ; \quad E=\frac{1}{2}\left[\left(\frac{W}{W} \times 195\right)-410\right]
\end{aligned}
$$

Molar mass of organic base $=$ Equivalent mass of base $\times$ acidity of the base

\section*{[Exinier 18 :}
0.532 g of the platinic chloride of a monoacid organic base left 0.195 g of platinum as residue on ignition. Calculate the equivalent \& molecular mass of the base. (At mass of $\mathrm{Pt}=195$ )\\
Sol. $\frac{\text { Mass of chloroplatinatesalt }}{\text { Massof } \mathrm{Pt} \text { residue }}=\frac{\text { Molar mass of chloroplatinatesalt }}{\text { Atomic weight of platinum }}$

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \frac{0.532}{0.195}=\frac{2 \mathrm{E}+410}{195} \\
& 2 \mathrm{E}=\left(\frac{0.532 \times 195}{0.195}\right)-410 \\
& \mathrm{E}=\frac{1}{2}\left[\left(\frac{0.532 \times 195}{0.195}\right)-410\right]
\end{aligned}
$$

Equivalent weight of base $=\frac{122}{2}=61$\\
The acidity of organic base is one thus molecular mass is equal to equivalent mass.\\

(b) $\mathrm{C}_{2} \mathrm{H}_{5} \mathrm{SH}$ is a stronger acid than $\mathrm{C}_{2} \mathrm{H}_{5} \mathrm{OH}$. Why ?

Sol. (a) (i) : $\stackrel{\ominus}{\mathrm{C}} \mathrm{Cl}_{3}$ is less basic than $\stackrel{\ominus}{\mathrm{C}} \mathrm{F}_{3}$.\\
F can disperse the charge only inductive effect.\\
\includegraphics{smile-9528c4b49722acdd546ae68ab2599f9b999c0b30}\\
(ii) In addition to inductive effect, Cl uses its empty 3 d orbitals to disperse the charge by $p-d \pi$ bonding. See Figure.

Remember that F is a second period element with no $d$ orbital, whereas Cl is a third period element with $3 d$ orbital. Hence $\mathrm{CHCl}_{3}$ is more acidic than $\mathrm{CHF}_{3}$.\\
(b) Since $\mathrm{C}_{2} \mathrm{H}_{5} \mathrm{SH}$ is a stronger acid, $\mathrm{C}_{2} \mathrm{H}_{5} \mathrm{~S}^{\Theta}$ its conjugate base is a weaker base than the corresponding $\mathrm{C}_{2} \mathrm{H}_{5} \mathrm{O}^{-}$.

Although both O and S belong to the same group in the periodic table, as S is larger in size than O , the negative charge on $\mathrm{C}_{2} \mathrm{H}_{5} \mathrm{~S}^{-}$(the conjugate base of $\mathrm{C}_{2} \mathrm{H}_{5} \mathrm{SH}$ ) can disperse over a larger base and hence $\mathrm{C}_{2} \mathrm{H}_{5} \mathrm{~S}$ is weaker base (or $\mathrm{C}_{2} \mathrm{H}_{5} \mathrm{SH}$ is a stronger acid ) than $\mathrm{C}_{2} \mathrm{H}_{5} \mathrm{O}^{-}$.

(b) In erythro $\alpha$, $\alpha^{\prime}$-dichlorosuccinic acid, the two halogen atoms are on the same side of the compound the two chiral centres. This on hydrolysis leads to meso tartaric acid, which is optically inactive.\\

Give suitable reason for the following statements.\\
(a) Although both benzamide $\left(\mathrm{C}_{6} \mathrm{H}_{5} \mathrm{CONH}_{2}\right)$ and aniline $\left(\mathrm{C}_{6} \mathrm{H}_{5} \mathrm{NH}_{2}\right)$ contain the $-\mathrm{NH}_{2}$ group, only aniline is soluble in dil. HCl ,\\
(b) Although both $\mathrm{C}_{6} \mathrm{H}_{5} \mathrm{CH}_{2} \mathrm{OH}$ (I) and $\mathrm{C}_{6} \mathrm{H}_{5} \mathrm{OH}$ (II) contain the -OH group, only (II) is soluble in aqueous NaOH .

Sol. (a) In aniline, the lone pair of electrons on N is delocalized over the benzene ring, while in benzamide it is also involved in delocalisation over the $\mathrm{C}=\mathrm{O}$ group; hence it is relatively less available for protonation; thus $\mathrm{C}_{6} \mathrm{H}_{5} \mathrm{CONH}_{2}$ is less basic while $\mathrm{C}_{6} \mathrm{H}_{5} \mathrm{NH}_{2}$ is more basic and dissolves in dil. HCl .\\

\includegraphics{smile-e613c8f035e5144abac7499cfb2433961123463b}\\
(b) Solubility of $\mathrm{C}_{6} \mathrm{H}_{5} \mathrm{OH}$ (II) in aq. NaOH is due to its acidic nature which in turn is due to high stability of its conjugate base $\left(\mathrm{C}_{6} \mathrm{H}_{5} \mathrm{O}^{-}\right)$owing to resonance\\

(II)\\
\includegraphics[max width=\textwidth, center]{2025_01_28_8470952b98110cec3aabg-118}

Such a resonance stabilization is not possible in $\mathrm{C}_{6} \mathrm{H}_{5} \mathrm{CH}_{2} \mathrm{O}^{-}$when a hydrogen is lost from $\mathrm{C}_{6} \mathrm{H}_{5} \mathrm{CH}_{2} \mathrm{OH}$.

(ii) : $\bar{c} 1:: \ddot{C}:: 0: \ddot{C} 1$.

805\\
Sol. (a) :C゚| C.Cll:\\
(b) Both are incorrect

In structure ( i ), oxygen has 10 electrons which is more than the octet. One of the chlorine atoms in structure (i) has a double bond.\\
In structure (ii), the total number of valence electrons are 22 as against the required $24 ; \mathrm{C}$ and O do not have their normal covalencies.

\section*{Q Prompyy 11:}
(a) Account for the fact that $\mathrm{SO}_{2}$ has a dipole moment ( $\mu=1.63 \mathrm{D}$ ), whereas $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ has no dipole moment ( $\mu=0$ )\\
(b) Account for the observation that ethanol $\mathrm{C}_{2} \mathrm{H}_{5} \mathrm{OH}\left(\mathrm{M}\right.$. wi. $=46$ ) boils at $78^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ whereas ethylamine $\mathrm{C}_{2} \mathrm{H}_{5} \mathrm{NH}_{2}$ (Mol. wt. $=45$ ), boils at $17^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ ?\\
Sol. (a) $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ is a linear molecule and the two $\mathrm{C}-\mathrm{O}$ bond dipole moments mutually cancel each other. On the other hand, $\mathrm{SO}_{2}$ molecule is angular, not linear, and hence $\mathrm{SO}_{2}$ has a dipole moment.\\
(b) Oxygen, being more electronegative than nitrogen, strong hydrogen bonds are formed in ethanol compared to the hydrogen bonds formed in ethylamine, and thus ethanol boils at higher temperature than ethylamine, although the molecular weights of both are nearly same.

\section*{Rationalize the following observations}
(a) $\mathrm{S}_{\mathrm{N}}{ }^{1}$ reactions always lead to racemic products\\
(b) Tautomers of a compound are in equilibrium with each other.\\
(c) Optically active 2-iodobutane on treatment with Nal in acetone gives a product which does not show optical activity.\\
(d) 2,6-Dimethylbenzoic acid fails to undergoesterification with alcohol under normal esterification conditions.

Sol. (a) In an $\mathrm{S}_{\mathrm{N}}$ ' reactions, two steps are inwols oct. The hirst step is a rate determining slow step which involves the ionization of the substrate to give a carbcoation. For exmple,

$$
\left.\left(\mathrm{CH}_{3}\right)_{3} \mathrm{CCl} \stackrel{\text { slow }}{\rightleftharpoons}\left(\mathrm{CH}_{3}\right)_{3} \mathrm{C}^{+}+\mathrm{Cl}^{-} \quad \text { (step }\right)
$$

The second step is a rapid step involving the attack of the incoming nucleophile to form the product.

$$
\left(\mathrm{CH}_{3}\right)_{3} \mathrm{C}^{+}+{ }^{-} \mathrm{OH} \xrightarrow{\text { fast }}\left(\mathrm{CH}_{3}\right)_{3} \mathrm{COH} \text { (Step il) }
$$

Since a planar carbocation is formed as an intermediste and the attack by the entering nucleophile can occur from the front as well as the back (being a planar structure) side, the product is racemic in nature, provided the three alkyl groups are different from each other.\\
(b) Tautomerism is a type of isomerism know $n$ as keto-enol tautomerism. The two forms viz, the kefo and the enol can coexist in equilibrium Depending on the structure, conditions and the medium, either of the forms dominate. For example, acetone exists as a keto form predominantly, while phenol exists mainly in the enol form. However, the keto or enol formcan mutually be interconverted. They are in dynamic equilibriun. For example,\\
\includegraphics[max width=\textwidth, center]{2025_01_28_8470952b98110cec3aabg-120(1)}\\
(c) To start with 2 -iodobutane is optically active. When Nai in acetone medium attacks, an $\mathrm{S}_{\mathrm{N}}{ }^{2}$ process occurs which should lead to inversion in configuration. However, at equilibrium there are fairly equal quantities of both ( + ) and $(-)$ forms of the product which is also 2 - iodobutane. Hence there is loss of optical activity due to racemization.\\
(d) The two bulky methyl groups in the 2 and 6 positions of the ring are vicinal to the main functional group ( COOH group) prevent the attack on carboxy function. Henceeither the esterification is slow or does not take place at all.\\

Explain why alkyl groups act as donors when attached to a $\pi$ system.\\
Sol. Carbon is slightly more electronegative than hydrogen. Thus, carbon atom in an alkyl (say methyl) group has higher electron density around it as compared with a H atom. As a result, alkyl groups are able to donate electrons inductively when attached to a $\pi$ system via hyperconjugation.

A mixture consisting of bromobenzene, $\boldsymbol{p}$-nitroaniline and $\boldsymbol{o}$-cresol is given. Indicate the steps to be followed for the separation of the mixture.

Sol. The given mixture is dissolved completely in solvent ether, so that it forms a clear and homogenous solution.\\
The ether solution containing the mixture is shaken with $10 \% \mathrm{NaOH}$ solution in a separating funnel and the two layers are allowed to separate. The lower aqueous layer is drained to a beaker and neutralised with dil. HCl , when ocresol comes out. Phenols are extracted by aqueous NaOH . The phenolic component is further extracted with ether and purified by distillation.\\
The remaining ether solution in the separating funnel is now shaken with $6 \mathrm{~N}(1: 1) \mathrm{HCl}$ and the two layers are separated. Ether layer, being lighter, is always on the top. The heavier aqueous acid layer containing the amine. (pnitroaniline) is neutralized and the free amine is obtained as a yellow solid.\\
The remaining ether solution, which contains bromobenzene is evaporated carefully to get bromobenzene ( $\mathrm{BP} .35^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ ).

$-\mathrm{NO}_{2}$ group is electron-withdrawing group, so it delocalises the negative charge on oxygen, and therefore stabilizes the anion. Therefore, $\mathrm{O}_{2} \mathrm{NCH}_{2} \mathrm{CH}_{2} \mathrm{O}^{-}$is more stable than $\mathrm{CH}_{3} \mathrm{CH}_{2} \mathrm{O}^{-}$.

(b) The specific rotation of one enantiomer was found to be $+\mathbf{1 5}^{\circ}$. This isomer has been obtained from a reaction in which there was $20 \%$ racemization and $80 \%$ retention of configuration. The angle of rotation of the mixture will be $+12.0^{\prime \prime}$\\
(c) $\mathrm{C}-\mathrm{Cl}$ bond is polar, but $\mathrm{CCl}_{4}$ is non-polar.\\
(d) $\mathrm{CH}_{3}(\mathrm{CHOH})_{2} \mathrm{COOH}$ exhibits optical isomerism and the number of optical isomers it can have will be 2.

Sol. (a) False.\\
(b) True. The mixture contains $90 \%$ of the pure enantiomer ( $10 \%$ form the racemic mixture plus $80 \%$ from the retention of configuration). The remaining $10 \%$ is due to inversion. So, the angle of rotation of the mixture observed will be $\alpha=$ $0.90(+15)+0.10(-15)=+12.0^{\circ}$\\
(c) True. The bond $\mathrm{C}-\mathrm{Cl}$ is polar in nature because of the difference in electronegativities of C and Cl . However, the molecule of $\mathrm{CCl}_{4}$ as a whole is non-polar, and the net dipole moment is zerobecause of the symmetry of the molecule.\\
(d) False. Only the first part of the statement is true as the compound can exhibit optical isomerism as there are two chiral centres in the molecules. However, the latter part of the statement is not correct as there can be 4 optical isomers for the compound, number of optical isumers $=2^{\prime \prime}$, where $n$ is the number of chiral centres in the molecule.

However, in case of $\mathrm{NH}_{2}{ }^{-}$, negative charge is concentrated over $1 / 3 \mathrm{rd}$ of N , which is further more in case of $\mathrm{OH}^{-}$ , here negative charge is concentrated over $1 / 2$ of oxygen atom. Thus the relative concentration of negative charge on the respective atoms of the three species is\\
\includegraphics[max width=\textwidth, center]{2025_01_28_8470952b98110cec3aabg-127}\\
$-\mathrm{OCH}_{3}$ is a strong base because of - I effect of the $\mathrm{CH}_{3}$ group\\
(b) Bromination is electrophilic substitution reaction, so any group that increases electron density on $o$ - and $p$ positions will facilitate bromination. . Recall that groups exhibiting +I and +M effects will increase bromination. Thus the order of bromination will be\\
\includegraphics[max width=\textwidth, center]{2025_01_28_8470952b98110cec3aabg-128(3)}\\
(c) $\mathrm{CH}_{3} \mathrm{CHO}<\mathrm{CH}_{3} \mathrm{COCH}_{3}<\mathrm{CH}_{3} \mathrm{COCH}_{2} \mathrm{CHO}<\mathrm{CH}_{3} \mathrm{COCH}_{2} \mathrm{COCH}_{3}<\mathrm{C}_{6} \mathrm{H}_{5} \mathrm{OH}$

In acetaldehyde and acetone, there is only one carbonyl function so that enol content is low. There is only one $\mathrm{CH}_{3}$ group in acetaldehyde, but there are two $\mathrm{CH}_{3}$ groups in acetone, so the enol content in acetone is slightly higher. In the case of $\mathrm{CH}_{3} \mathrm{COCH}_{2} \mathrm{CHO}$, there are two carbonyl groups and an active methylene centre. In the case of acetyl acetone, there is an active methylene group, two carbonyl groups and two methyl groups. So the enol forms can be\\
\includegraphics[max width=\textwidth, center]{2025_01_28_8470952b98110cec3aabg-128(1)}

Hence comparatively greater enol content is expected. In the case of phenol, the compound exists exclusively in the enol form, as it is completely aromatic and the keto form is least favourable as the aromaticity is destroyed.\\
(d) The deciding factor towards the order of reactivity in E2 elimination is that a more branched alkyl halide leads to a more branched olefin which is more stable. So the stability of alkenes formed decides the rate of dehydrohalogenation. So the reactivity order is $3^{\circ}>2^{\circ}>1^{\circ}$. On this basis, the alkyl halides can be arranged in the decreasing order as follows.\\

(b) meso tartaric acid is optically inactive, although it contains 2 chiral centres ?\\
(c) $\mathrm{S}_{\mathrm{N}} 2$ reaction of an optically active substrate always proceeds with inversion of configuration ?

\includegraphics[max width=\textwidth, center]{2025_01_28_8470952b98110cec3aabg-128}\\
(b) Although meso-tartaric acid contains two chiral centres, but the optical activity exhibited by one centre is exactly equal and opposite to that produced by the other centre and hence they mutually cancel one against the other internally and the net optical activity is zero.\\
\includegraphics{smile-a0bd496b278b163e0acbf4316215b97529aa3d29}\\

How many litres of oxygen at NTP will be needed to complete the reaction when 39 grams of benzene are used ?\\
Sol. (a) The compound is a chlorohydrocarbon. So the compound contains $\mathrm{C}, \mathrm{H}$ and Cl .\\
Percentage of $\mathrm{C}=64$, percentage of $\mathrm{H}=4.4$\\
The rest should be chlorine.\\
Percentage of $\mathrm{Cl}=31.6$\\
Elemental composition from the percentage :

$$
\mathrm{C}=\frac{64}{12}=5.3 ; \mathrm{H}=\frac{4.4}{1}=4.4 ; \mathrm{Cl}=\frac{31.6}{35}=0.9
$$

So, the empirical formula is

$$
\mathrm{C}=\frac{5.3}{0.9}=6 ; \quad \mathrm{H}=\frac{4.4}{9}=5 ; \quad \mathrm{Cl}=\frac{0.9}{0.9}=1
$$

Empirical formula is $\mathrm{C}_{6} \mathrm{H}_{5} \mathrm{Cl}$; Molecular weight is 112.5\\
Hence, molecular formula and empirical formula are the same, i.e., $\mathrm{C}_{6} \mathrm{H}_{5} \mathrm{Cl}$\\
The compound burns with a smoky flame, it shows that the compound is aromatic. Since the compound contains Cl , but still does not give a precipitate with alcoholic $\mathrm{AgNO}_{3}$, it shows that chlorine is attached to the aromatic nucleus. Based on the information available, one structure that can be proposed for the compound is\\

Sol. Carbon dioxide is weakly acidic, while potassium hydroxide is strongly alkaline. It reacts with $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ to form $\mathrm{KHCO}_{3}$ and $\mathrm{K}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}$\\
Q Farmbey 47 :\\
A sample of 0.50 g of an organic compound was treated according to Kjeldahl's method. The ammonia evolved was absorbed in 50 mL of $0.5 \mathrm{M} \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{SO}_{4}$. The residual acid required 60 mL of 0.5 M solution of NaOH for neutralisation. Find the percentage of nitrogen in the compound.\\
Sol. Volume of $0.5 \mathrm{M} \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{SO}_{4}$ solution $=50 \mathrm{~mL}$\\
Using molarity equation, $60 \mathrm{~mL} \times 0.5 \mathrm{M}=2 \times \mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{SO}_{4}} \times 0.5 \mathrm{M}$

$$
\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{SO}_{4}}=30 \mathrm{~mL}
$$

Thus, volume of $0.5 \mathrm{M} \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{SO}_{4}$ used for neutralising ammonia $=(50 \mathrm{~mL}-30 \mathrm{~mL})=20 \mathrm{~mL}$\\
Percentage of nitrogen in the sample $=\frac{1.4 \times \text { Normality of acid } \times \text { Volume of acid used for neutralising } \mathrm{NH}_{3}}{\text { Mass of the compound taken }}$\\
Percentage of nitrogen in the sample $=\frac{1.4 \times 1.0 \times 20 \mathrm{~mL}}{0.5}=56 \%$\\

\section*{PASSAGE - 2}
Structural isomers have different covalent linkage of afoms. Stereoisomers are compounds that have same sequence of covalent bonds but differ in the relative disposition of their atoms in space. Geometrical and optical isomers are the two important types of configurational isomers.\\
The compound with double bond or ring structure has restricted rotation, so exist in two geometrical forms. If the ring is larget (ring size 10 carbon or large), it can also cause geometrical isomerism. The optical isomers rotate the plane of polarised light. Asp ${ }^{3}$-hybridised carbon atom bearing fout differeat types of substituents is called an asymmetric centre or chiral centre. A chiral object or molecule carmot be superimposed on its mirror image. Stereoisomers that are mirmer image of each other are called enantiomers. The stereoisomers that are not mirror images of each other are called diastereomens. Diastereomers have different physical properties.\\
A racemic mixture isoptically inactive and contains equal amount of both the enantiomers. Resolution refers to method of separating a racemic mixhure into two pure enantiomers. A meso compound is an optically inactive stereoisomer, which is achural due to the presence of an internal plane of syanmetry or centre of symmetry within the molecule.\\

The concept of resonance explains various properties of compounds. The molecules with conjugated system of $\pi$ bonds are stabilized by resonance and have low heat of hydrogenation. Hyperconjugation stabilization also decreases heat of hydrogenation. In aromatic rings a functional group with a lone pair of electrons exerts + effect. Some functional groups like $-\mathrm{NO},-\mathrm{NC},-\mathrm{CH}=$ $\mathrm{CH}_{2}$ can function both as electron releasing $(+\mathrm{M},+\mathrm{R})$ or electron withdrawing ( $-\mathrm{M},-\mathrm{R}$ ) groups. More extended conjugation provides more stabilization.\\

\section*{EXERCISE 1}
(1) (a) In the option (a) compounds are 2-methyl 2butane and 2,2-dimethylpropane respectively. In (b) \& (c) options all the compounds are same i.e. 2 methylbutane. In (d) both are $n$-pentane.\\
(2) (a) A screw driver has a plane of symmetry. Hence it is achiral. The other three choices mentioned have chirality of handedness. They are not superimposable.\\
(3) (b) Remembers that cis-tans-geometrical isomerism is possible only in alkenes and further only in those alkenes in which the doubly bonded carbon atoms individually have different atoms/groups.\\
(5) (c) Inductive effect causes a state of polarization, but it is feeble as it involves the shift of strongly held $\sigma$-bonds. The concept of $+I$ and $-I$ effects is due to the inductive effect arising by atoms or groups which are electron releasing and electron with-drawing respectively.\\
(b) 3C $\rightarrow$ Propion, Suffix is amide\\
(7)\\
\includegraphics[max width=\textwidth, center]{2025_01_28_8470952b98110cec3aabg-157}\\
(8) (d) If the $\alpha$-hydrogen atoms are present on both the carbons attached to carbonyl group, more stable is the enol form and hence more is its content in keto-enol tautomerism. If the number of such carbonyl groups is more, more is the enol content. The order of stability of enol form and enol content is $\mathrm{CH}_{3} \mathrm{COCH}_{2} \mathrm{COCH}_{3}$ $>\mathrm{CH}_{3} \mathrm{COCH}_{2} \mathrm{CHO}>\mathrm{CH}_{3} \mathrm{COCH}_{3}>\mathrm{CH}_{3} \mathrm{CHO}$\\
(11) (d) Only compound (D) has two chiral centres.\\
(12) (c) The presence of both nitrogen and sulphur in the Lassaigne's extract in an organic compound gives a blood red colouration with $\mathrm{FeCl}_{3}$ solution. This is due to the formation of NaCNS in the sodium fusion extract.\\
(13) (b) $\mathrm{CH}_{2}=\mathrm{CH}-\mathrm{CH}_{2}$ - is allyl group.\\
(14) (d) Sublimation is a purification process applicable to solids only. Liquid state is not involved in sublimation.\\
(15) (a) $\mathrm{CH}_{2}=\mathrm{CH}$ - is called as vinyl group.\\
(17) (a) $4 C+(\Rightarrow) \rightarrow$ croton Suffix 'ic' acid.\\
(18) (b) The total number of paired or unpaired electrons in resonating structures should be the same. The resonating structures are all hypothetical and they do not exist and they cannot be isolated.\\
(a) The presence of a double bond followed by three chlorine atoms in the adjacent carbon makes (iii) the strongest acid. In (i), the acid strength is a bit decreased because of the intervening - $\mathrm{CH}_{2}$ - group (ii) has no Cl but double bond, (iv) being a saturated acid, is weakest acid.\\
(20) (a) The order of stability of carbocations is $3^{\circ}>2^{\circ}>1^{\circ}$. So a $1^{\circ}$ carbocation is least stable. This becomes less stable when an electron with-drawing halogen is attached to the adjacent centre. Greater the number of halogens, lesser the stability.\\
(23)\\
(b) $\mathrm{CH}_{3} \mathrm{CH}_{2} \mathrm{CH}_{2} \mathrm{C} \equiv \mathrm{CH}$;\\
\includegraphics{smile-c6f6303f206739bf0b8d2d4f0d9bfe61cba2b2a6}\\
$\mathrm{CH}_{3} \mathrm{CH}_{2} \mathrm{C} \equiv \mathrm{CCH}_{3}$\\
(a) A carbon must be attached with four carbons.\\
(c) Metamerism is observed when there is change in alkyl group.\\
(d) In Kjeldahl's method for the estimation of nitrogen in an organic compound, the starting material is heated strongly with conc. $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{SO}_{4}$ and converted to $\left(\mathrm{NH}_{4}\right)_{2} \mathrm{SO}_{4}$.\\
(b) $3 C+(\Rightarrow) \rightarrow$ Acryl Suffix is aldehyde.\\
(a) Beilstein test is not very reliable for the testing of halogens because certain compounds which do not contain the halogen, for example urea $\left(\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{NCONH}_{2}\right)$, gives a positive Beilstein test. Hence, it is generally said that a negative Beilstein is more reliable than a positive Beilstein.\\
(32)\\
(a) $\mathrm{CH}_{3}-\mathrm{CH}_{2}-{ }^{3} \mathrm{CH}-{ }^{4} \mathrm{CH}_{2}-{ }^{5} \mathrm{CH}-\mathrm{CH}_{3}$

2-4,dibromo-3-methylhexane\\
(33)\\
(d) Addition of bromine to cis-2-butene gives a racemic mixture of 2,3-dibromobutane, while addition of $\mathrm{Br}_{2}$ to trans-2-butene gives meso form of 2,3 dibromobutane.\\
(34) (c) In 2, 4-dinitrophenol both nitrosubstituents are present either in $o$ - or in $p$-positions hence, these are involved in resonance stabilsation.\\
(35) (d) The statement (d) is false because the $\pi$-bond is not as strong as a $\sigma$-bond as the $\pi$ electrons are not on the internuclear axis and the overlapping effect is partial.\\
(37)\\

\section*{1,3-dimethoxybutane}
(38) (a) In 2-phenyl-2-butene, both of the doubly bonded carbon atoms are linked to two different groups.\\
\includegraphics[max width=\textwidth, center]{2025_01_28_8470952b98110cec3aabg-158}\\
(39) (a) $\mathrm{CH}_{2}=\mathrm{CH}-\mathrm{CHO}$ unsaturated aldehyde.\\
(40) (a) A $3^{\circ}$ free radical is more stable than $2^{\circ}$ free radical and the latter is more stable than $1^{\circ}$ free radical. This is due to the fact that the presence of more alkyl groups helps in larger dispersion of unpaired electron. Resonance helps in dispersion of unpaired electron, hence the stability of free radicals follows the order : $3^{\circ}$ Aryl $>2^{\circ}$ Aryl $>$ benzyl $>$ allyl $>$ alkyl. Thus the stability order is

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \left(\mathrm{C}_{6} \mathrm{H}_{5}\right)_{3} \mathrm{C} \cdot>\left(\mathrm{C}_{6} \mathrm{H}_{5}\right)_{2} \mathrm{CH} \cdot>\mathrm{C}_{6} \mathrm{H}_{5} \mathrm{CH}_{2} \cdot> \\
& \mathrm{CH}_{2}=\mathrm{CH}-\mathrm{CH}_{2} \cdot>\left(\mathrm{CH}_{3}\right)_{3} \mathrm{C} \cdot
\end{aligned}
$$

(41) (b) More directionally concentrated orbitals show more overlapping. Moreover, more closer are shells to the nucleus more is the overlapping.\\

2,4-Dimethylpentane is the compound having two- $3^{\circ}$ carbon \& one- $2^{\circ}$ carbon atoms. It has four $1^{\circ}$ carbon atoms.\\
(b) $\mathrm{NH}_{4} \mathrm{CNO} \xrightarrow{\text { heat }} \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{NCO} . \mathrm{NH}_{2}$

Nothing is added or eliminated, only rearrangement among atoms is observed.\\
(a) In $\mathrm{CH}_{3} \mathrm{NH}_{2}$, the non-bonding pair of electrons is in $s p^{3}$ orbital, while in a compound containing a double bonded nitrogen it is in $s p^{2}$ orbital. The electrons in s-orbital are more firmly bonded than in a p-orbital because s-orbital electrons are closer to the nucleus. The amount of s-character increases with unsaturation, so the electrons in pyridine ( $s p^{2}$ hybridised) are more tightly bound and are not easily available for bonding. Thus pyridine is less basic than methylamine.\\

(ii) When mixture ' $B$ ' is treated with a solution of strong alkali like NaOH or KOH , salt of benzoic acid is formed, which is water soluble. As nitrobenzene does not react with alkali, it remains as an oily liquid. Now this mixture should be taken in a separating funnel and separate aqueous and oily layers. Treat the aqueous layer with dilute HCl to regenerate benzoic acid as white precipitate. Oily layer is nitrobenzene.\\

\section*{INTRODUCTION}
The simplest organic compounds are hydrocarbons. Hydrocarbons are compounds formed by the combination of carbon and hydrogen only. Petrol, diesel, kerosene, liquid petroleum gas (LPG) and condensed natural gas (CNG) etc. are all hydrocarbons or are their mixtures. All organic compounds can be considered as the derivatives of hydrocarbons, obtained by substituting hydrogen with an appropriate functional group. Hydrocarbons are broadly classified as\\
\includegraphics[max width=\textwidth, center]{2025_01_28_8470952b98110cec3aabg-169}

Alkanes are quite stable compounds and give substitution reactions while alkenes and alkynes are more reactive and give addition reactions.

\section*{ALKANE AND CYCLOALKANES}
Saturated hydrocarbons are known as alkanes or paraffins (less reactive). Alkanes with straight carbon chains are called normal alkanes. Each member of the series differ from the next higher and next lower member by $-\mathrm{CH}_{2}$ group. General formula is $\mathrm{C}_{n} \mathrm{H}_{2 n+2^{\prime}}$ where $n$ is the number of carbon atom. All the carbon atoms in alkanes are in $s p^{3}$ state of hybridization. All the bond angles are tetrahedral angles i.e., $\mathrm{H}-\mathrm{C}-\mathrm{H}$ or $\mathrm{H}-\mathrm{C}-\mathrm{C}$ bond angle is $109^{\circ} 28^{\prime}$. Alkanes are insoluble in water. The reason is that water molecules are polar whereas alkanes are non-polar ( $\mathrm{C}-\mathrm{C}$ and $\mathrm{C}-\mathrm{H}$ bonds are nearly purely covalent) Like does not dissolve unlike. Alkane molecules are non planar because all the carbon atoms possess $s p^{3}$ hybridisation state.

Cycloalkanes : The saturated homocyclic or carbocyclic hydrocarbons are called cycloparaffins or cycloalkanes. As their structure contains several- $\mathrm{CH}_{2}-$ groups which join with each other to form a ring, these are also called as polymethylenes, In naming these compounds, the carbon atoms present in the ring are counted and this number (tri, tetra, penta .........) is written before methylene. The general formula of these compounds is $\mathrm{C}_{n} \mathrm{H}_{2 n}$.\\

\section*{MEIHODS OF PREPARATION (ALKANES)}
\section*{(i) Reduction of alkyl halides :-}
$$
\xrightarrow[\text { Alkyl halide }]{\mathrm{R}-\mathrm{X} \xrightarrow{\text { Reductant }} \mathrm{R}-\mathrm{H}+\mathrm{HX}} \text { Alkane }
$$

Reductants : $\mathrm{Zn}-\mathrm{Cu}$ couple/ $\mathrm{EtOH}, \mathrm{Na}-\mathrm{EtOH}, \mathrm{Zn}-\mathrm{HCl}, \mathrm{Pt}$ or Pd or $\mathrm{Ni} / \mathrm{H}_{2} ; \mathrm{Al}-\mathrm{Hg} / \mathrm{EtOH}, \mathrm{LiAlH}_{4}$ etc.\\
Ex. $\quad \mathrm{CH}_{3} \mathrm{I}+\mathrm{Zn}-\mathrm{Cu} /$ alcohol $\rightarrow \mathrm{CH}_{4}+\mathrm{H}-\mathrm{I}$\\
(ii) From carboxylic acids:\\
(a) By de-carboxylation of a fatty acid:\\
$\mathrm{RCOONa}+\mathrm{NaOH} / \mathrm{CaO} \xrightarrow{\Delta} \mathrm{R}-\mathrm{H}+\mathrm{Na}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}$\\
Sodium carboxylate Soda lime Alkane $(n-1)$\\
Ex. $\mathrm{CH}_{3} \mathrm{COONa}+\mathrm{NaOH}(\mathrm{CaO}) \longrightarrow \mathrm{CH}_{4}+\mathrm{Na}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}$\\
$\mathrm{CH}_{3} \mathrm{CH}_{2} \mathrm{COONa}+\mathrm{NaOH}(\mathrm{CaO}) \longrightarrow \mathrm{C}_{2} \mathrm{H}_{6}+\mathrm{CH}_{4}+\mathrm{CH}_{2}=\mathrm{CH}_{2}+\mathrm{H}_{2}$ main product\\
Since the -COOH group present in the original acid is removed in the process (in the form of carbonate), the reaction is commonly known as decarboxylation.\\
(b) Kolbe's electrolytic synthesis :

$$
\begin{aligned}
& 2 \mathrm{RCOONa}_{2} \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O} \xrightarrow{\text { Electrolysis }} \mathrm{R}-\mathrm{R}+2 \mathrm{CO}_{2}+\mathrm{H}_{2}+2 \mathrm{NaOH} \\
& 2 \mathrm{CH}_{3} \mathrm{COONa}+2 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O} \longrightarrow \mathrm{CH}_{3}-\mathrm{CH}_{3}+2 \mathrm{CO}_{2}+2 \mathrm{NaOH}+\mathrm{H}_{2}
\end{aligned}
$$

Mechanism : Ionic free radical : $2 \mathrm{CH}_{3} \mathrm{COONa} \longrightarrow 2 \mathrm{CH}_{3} \mathrm{COO}^{-}+2 \mathrm{Na}^{+}$\\
At anode: $2 \mathrm{CH}_{3} \mathrm{COO}^{-} \longrightarrow 2 \mathrm{CH}_{3} \mathrm{COO}^{+}+2 \mathrm{e}$\\
$2 \mathrm{CH}_{3} \mathrm{COO}^{*} \longrightarrow 2 \mathrm{CH}_{3}{ }^{\circ}+2 \mathrm{CO}_{2}$\\
$\mathrm{CH}_{3}{ }^{+}+\mathrm{CH}_{3}{ }^{+} \longrightarrow \mathrm{CH}_{3}-\mathrm{CH}_{3}$\\
At cathode : $2 \mathrm{Na}^{+}+2 \mathrm{e} \longrightarrow 2 \mathrm{Na}$\\
$2 \mathrm{Na}+2 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O} \longrightarrow 2 \mathrm{NaOH}+\mathrm{H}_{2} \uparrow$\\
(iii) Wurtz reaction:\\
\includegraphics[max width=\textwidth, center]{2025_01_28_8470952b98110cec3aabg-171}

Ex. $\mathrm{CH}_{3}-\mathrm{I}+2 \mathrm{Na}+\mathrm{I}-\mathrm{CH}_{3} \xrightarrow[\text { Ether }]{\Delta \text {. Dry }} \mathrm{CH}_{3}-\mathrm{CH}_{3}+2 \mathrm{NaI}$\\
Methyl iodide\\
Ethane\\
Methane cannot be prepared by this method. The alkane produced is higher and symmetrical i.e., it contains double the number of carbon atoms present in the alkyl halide taken. When the two reacting alkyl halides are different, a mixture of three different alkanes is obtained. The wurtz reaction is not useful for preparing unsymmetrical alkanes.

$$
\mathrm{C}_{2} \mathrm{H}_{5} \mathrm{I}+\mathrm{CH}_{3} \mathrm{I} \longrightarrow \mathrm{C}_{2} \mathrm{H}_{5} \mathrm{CH}_{3}+\mathrm{CH}_{3} \mathrm{CH}_{3}+\mathrm{C}_{2} \mathrm{H}_{5} \mathrm{C}_{2} \mathrm{H}_{5}
$$

Mechanism : Wurtz reaction may proceed via the formation of organometallic compound or alkyl free radicals.

$$
2 \mathrm{C}_{2} \mathrm{H}_{5} \mathrm{Br}+2 \mathrm{Na} \xrightarrow{\text { Dry elher }} \mathrm{C}_{2} \mathrm{H}_{5}-\mathrm{C}_{2} \mathrm{H}_{5}+2 \mathrm{NaBr}
$$

(a) Ionic reaction (organometallic mechanism)

$$
\mathrm{C}_{2} \mathrm{H}_{5} \mathrm{Br}+2 \mathrm{Na} \longrightarrow \xrightarrow[\substack{\text { Ethyl sodium } \\ \text { (organometallic) }}]{\mathrm{C}_{2} \mathrm{H}_{5}-\mathrm{Na}^{+}+\mathrm{NaBr}}
$$

(b) Free radical reactions :

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \mathrm{C}_{2} \mathrm{H}_{5} \mathrm{Br}+\mathrm{Na} \longrightarrow \underset{\substack{\text { Ethyl free radical } \\
\mathrm{C}_{2} \mathrm{H}_{5}^{*}}}{\mathrm{NaBr}} \\
& \mathrm{C}_{2} \mathrm{H}_{5}^{*}+\mathrm{C}_{2} \mathrm{H}_{5}^{*} \xrightarrow{\text { Dimerisation }} \mathrm{C}_{2} \mathrm{H}_{5}-\mathrm{C}_{2} \mathrm{H}_{5}
\end{aligned}
$$

(iv) From Grignard reagent:

$$
\mathrm{RMgX} \xrightarrow{\mathrm{Z}-\mathrm{H}} \mathrm{RH}+\mathrm{Mg}(\mathrm{Z}) \mathrm{X}
$$

ZH [compound containing active hydrogen]\\
$\mathrm{HOH}, \mathrm{NH}_{3}, \mathrm{RC} \equiv \mathrm{CH}, \mathrm{C}_{6} \mathrm{H}_{5} \mathrm{OH}, \mathrm{CH}_{3} \mathrm{COOH}, \mathrm{RNH}_{2}, \mathrm{R}_{2} \mathrm{NH}$, Pyrrole, $\mathrm{C}_{2} \mathrm{H}_{5} \mathrm{OH}$ etc.\\
Ex. $\mathrm{C}_{2} \mathrm{H}_{5} \mathrm{MgI}+\mathrm{HOH} \longrightarrow \mathrm{C}_{2} \mathrm{H}_{6}+\mathrm{Mgl}(\mathrm{OH})$

$$
\mathrm{C}_{2} \mathrm{H}_{5} \mathrm{MgI}+\mathrm{RC} \equiv \mathrm{CH} \longrightarrow \mathrm{C}_{2} \mathrm{H}_{6}+\mathrm{MgI}(\mathrm{C} \equiv \mathrm{CR})
$$

(v) Frankland's reaction :

$$
\mathrm{RI}+\mathrm{Zn}+\mathrm{RI} \xrightarrow{\Delta} \underset{\text { Alkane }}{\mathrm{R}-\mathrm{R}+\mathrm{ZnI}_{2} .}
$$

(vi) From alkenes and alkynes: (Sabatier Senderen's reaction):

$$
\mathrm{R}-\mathrm{CH}=\mathrm{CH}-\mathrm{R}^{\prime}+\mathrm{H}_{2} \xrightarrow[\text { Ni } / 300^{\mathrm{a}}]{\mathrm{H}_{2}} \mathrm{R}-\mathrm{CH}_{2}-\mathrm{CH}_{2}-\mathrm{R}^{\prime}
$$

Olefin\\
Alkane

$$
\mathrm{R}-\mathrm{C} \equiv \mathrm{C}-\mathrm{R}^{\prime}+2 \mathrm{H}_{2} \xrightarrow[\mathrm{Ni} / 300^{\circ}]{\stackrel{\mathrm{H}_{2}}{ }} \mathrm{R}-\mathrm{CH}_{2}-\mathrm{CH}_{2}-\mathrm{R}^{\prime}
$$

When the catalysts are Pt or Pd , hydrogenation proceeds smoothly at ordinary temperature and pressure. With nickel catalyst, higher temperature $\left(250^{\circ}-300^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\right)$ and pressure are needed.\\
(vii) Reduction of alcohols, aldehydes, ketones and acids :\\
(a) By the reduction of alcohols:

$$
\mathrm{R}-\mathrm{OH}+\mathrm{HI} \xrightarrow[150^{\circ} \mathrm{C}]{\mathrm{Red} \mathrm{P}} \mathrm{RI}+\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}
$$

$$
\mathrm{R}-\mathrm{I}+\mathrm{HI} \xrightarrow{\Delta} \mathrm{R}-\mathrm{H}+\mathrm{I}_{2}
$$

(b) By the reduction of aldehydes and ketones:\\
\includegraphics[max width=\textwidth, center]{2025_01_28_8470952b98110cec3aabg-172(1)}

Wolf-Kishner reduction : Both aldehydes and ketones are reduced to parent alkanes by treatment with $\mathrm{NH}_{2}-\mathrm{NH}_{2} /$ $\mathrm{C}_{2} \mathrm{H}_{5} \mathrm{ONa}$\\
\includegraphics[max width=\textwidth, center]{2025_01_28_8470952b98110cec3aabg-172(3)}

Clemmensen reduction : Ketones are quantitatively reduced to parent alkanes by treatment with zinc amalgam and conc. HCl while aldehydes show some polymerisation\\
\includegraphics[max width=\textwidth, center]{2025_01_28_8470952b98110cec3aabg-172(4)}\\
(c) By reduction of acid: $\mathrm{RCOOH}+6 \mathrm{HI} \xrightarrow[150^{\circ} \mathrm{C}]{\mathrm{Red} \mathrm{P}} \mathrm{RCH}_{3}+3 \mathrm{I}_{2}+2 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$

\section*{(viii) From dialkylzinc:}
\includegraphics[max width=\textwidth, center]{2025_01_28_8470952b98110cec3aabg-172}\\
(ix) Corey-House synthesis:\\
\includegraphics[max width=\textwidth, center]{2025_01_28_8470952b98110cec3aabg-172(2)}

Alkyl halide which is used to react with dialkyl lithium cuprate should be a primary ( $\mathrm{R}-\mathrm{CH}_{2}-\mathrm{X}$ ) or secondary alkyl halide ( $\mathrm{R}-\mathrm{CH}(\mathrm{X})-\mathrm{R}$ ). Tertiary alkyl halides, if used, form alkenes, not alkanes.

\section*{METHANE $\left(\mathrm{CH}_{4}\right)$ :}
(a) Methane is also called marsh gas or damp fire.\\
(b) Natural gas $=80 \% \mathrm{CH}_{4}+20 \% \mathrm{C}_{2}$ to $\mathrm{C}_{6}$\\
(c) Coal gas $=40 \% \mathrm{CH}_{4}$\\
(d) CNG (Compressed natural gas) $=\mathrm{CH}_{4}(84 \%)+$ propane + butane + Higher alkane.\\
(e) LPG is called as liquefied petroleum gas or kitchen gas or domestic gas.

(iv) $\mathrm{CH}_{4}+\mathrm{NH}_{3} \xrightarrow[\text { High temp. }]{\mathrm{Al}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{3}} \mathrm{HCN}+\mathrm{H}_{2}$

\section*{PHYSICAL PROPERTIES OF ALKANES:}
(i) Alkanes from $\mathrm{C}_{1}-\mathrm{C}_{4}$ are colourless, odourless gases.\\
$\mathrm{C}_{5}-\mathrm{C}_{17}$ are colourless liquids, $\mathrm{C}_{18}$ - onwards are waxy, white solids.\\
(ii) Boiling points: Boiling points of alkanes are lowest among all groups of organic compounds. The forces of attraction among alkane molecules are weakest vander Waal's forces of attraction.\\
Among isomeric alkanes, the boiling point decreases with increasing branching,\\
Ex. $n$-Pentane $>$ iso-Pentane $>$ neo-Pentane. ; B.P $\propto$ Mol. wt. (for homologous)

$$
\text { B. } P \propto \frac{1}{\text { lateral chain }} \text { (for Isomers) }

(iii) Melting point : Unbranched alkanes containing $2,4,6,8$ etc. carbon atoms have higher melting points than the unbranched alkanes containing 3, 5, 7, 9 etc. carbon atoms.

\section*{CHEMICAL PROPERTIES OF ALKANES:}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Stability : Although alkanes are chemically urreactive under ordinary conditions due to the presence of strong $\mathrm{C}-\mathrm{C}$ and $\mathrm{C}-\mathrm{H}$ sigma ( $\sigma$ ) bonds, yet they give following reactions under special conditions.
  \item Substitution reactions:\\
(a) Halogenation : $\mathrm{R}-\mathrm{H}+\mathrm{X}_{2} \xrightarrow{\text { hv }} \mathrm{R}-\mathrm{X}+\mathrm{HX}$
\end{enumerate}

Reactivity order of hydrogen atoms in alkanes is $3^{\circ} \mathrm{H}>2^{\circ} \mathrm{H}>1^{\circ} \mathrm{H}$\\
Reactivity order of halogens is $\mathrm{F}_{2} \gg \mathrm{Cl}_{2}>\mathrm{Br}_{2}>\mathrm{I}_{2}$\\
Fluorine can react even in dark, $\mathrm{Cl}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{Br}_{2}$ require light energy, while $\mathrm{I}_{2}$ does not show any reaction even at room temperature, however on heating it shows iodination.\\
(i) Fluorination: Direct fluorination of alkanes is usually explosive.\\
$\mathrm{CH}_{4}+\mathrm{F}_{2} \longrightarrow \mathrm{C}+4 \mathrm{HF}$\\
It is carried out successfully by diluting fluorine with nitrogen and carrying out the reaction in a metal tube packed with copper gauze at a temperature of $150^{\circ} \mathrm{C}-350^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. Product of fluorination is usually a complex mixture.

$$
\text { (ii)Chlorination: } \begin{array}{ll}
\mathrm{CH}_{4}+\mathrm{F}_{2} \longrightarrow \\
\mathrm{R}-\mathrm{H}+\mathrm{Cl}_{2} \xrightarrow{\longrightarrow} \xrightarrow{\text { Alkyl chloride }} \mathrm{R}-\mathrm{Cl}+\mathrm{HCl}
\end{array}
$$

The monochloro derivative of alkane is obtained by taking alkane in large excess.\\
Ex. $\mathrm{C}_{2} \mathrm{H}_{6}+\mathrm{Cl}_{2} \xrightarrow{\text { uv }} \mathrm{C}_{2} \mathrm{H}_{5} \mathrm{Cl}+\mathrm{HCl}$\\
Ethane (Excess)\\
Ethyl chloride\\
When chlorine is in excess, a mixture of mono, di tri, tetra and perchloro derivatives is obtained.\\
Ex. $\mathrm{CH}_{4} \xrightarrow{\mathrm{hv}, \mathrm{Cl}_{2}} \mathrm{CH}_{3} \mathrm{Cl} \xrightarrow{\mathrm{Cl}_{2}} \mathrm{CH}_{2} \mathrm{Cl}_{2} \xrightarrow{\mathrm{Cl}_{2}} \mathrm{CHCl}_{3} \xrightarrow{\mathrm{Cl}_{2}} \mathrm{CCl}_{4}$\\
Chlorination of alkanes takes place in the following conditions.\\
At $300^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ in dark, at $100^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ in the presence of organic peroxides and at $150^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ in the presence of tetraethyllead,\\
chlorination of methane is a free radical reaction and involves following three steps :\\
(a) Chain intiating (first) step : $\quad \mathrm{Cl}_{2} \longrightarrow \mathrm{Cl}^{\bullet}+\mathrm{Cl}^{\bullet}$\\
(b) Chain propagating (second) step: $\mathrm{Cl}^{\bullet}+\mathrm{CH}_{4} \longrightarrow \mathrm{CH}_{3}{ }^{*}+\mathrm{HCl}$\\
$\mathrm{CH}_{3}{ }^{*}+\mathrm{Cl}_{2} \longrightarrow \mathrm{CH}_{3} \mathrm{Cl}+\mathrm{Cl}^{\circ}$\\
(c) Chain terminating (third) step:\\
\includegraphics[max width=\textwidth, center]{2025_01_28_8470952b98110cec3aabg-173}\\
(iii) Bromination : Bromination of alkanes is similar to chlorination but not so vigorous.\\
(iv) Iodination : Iodination of alkanes is reversible.

$$
\mathrm{CH}_{4}+\mathrm{I}_{2} \stackrel{\Delta}{\rightleftharpoons} \mathrm{CH}_{3}-\mathrm{I}+\mathrm{HI}
$$

Iodination may be carried out in presence of an oxidising agent such as $\mathrm{HIO}_{3}, \mathrm{HNO}_{3}, \mathrm{HgO}$, etc, which destroys the HI formed in the reaction and so drives the reaction to the right.

$$
5 \mathrm{HI}+\mathrm{HIO}_{3} \longrightarrow 3 \mathrm{I}_{2}+3 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}
$$

(b) Nitration: When a mixture of alkane and vapours of fuming nitric acid is heated between $150^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ and $475^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, a complex mixture of nitroalkanes is obtained.

$$
\mathrm{R}-[\mathrm{H}+\mathrm{HO}]-\mathrm{NO}_{2} \xrightarrow{\text { high temp. }} \mathrm{R}-\mathrm{NO}_{2}+\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}
$$

vapours form\\
Ex. $\mathrm{CH}_{3} \mathrm{CH}_{2} \mathrm{CH}_{3}+\mathrm{HNO}_{\text {vapor }} \xrightarrow{450^{\circ} \mathrm{C}} \underset{(40 \%)}{\mathrm{CH}_{3} \mathrm{CHCH}_{3}}+\underset{(25 \%)}{\mathrm{CH}_{3} \mathrm{CH}_{2} \mathrm{CH}_{2} \mathrm{NO}_{2}}+\underset{(10 \%)}{\mathrm{CH}_{3} \mathrm{CH}_{2} \mathrm{NO}_{2}+\underset{(25 \%)}{\mathrm{CH}_{3} \mathrm{NO}_{2}}}$\\
(c) Sulphonation: In this reaction, hydrogen atom of the $\mathrm{C}-\mathrm{H}$ bond is replaced by $-\mathrm{SO}_{3} \mathrm{H}$ group.

$$
\mathrm{R}+\mathrm{H}+\mathrm{HO}+\mathrm{SO}_{3} \mathrm{H} \longrightarrow \mathrm{R}-\mathrm{SO}_{3} \mathrm{H}+\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}
$$

Lower alkanes are not sulphonated, but branched or higher alkane if heated with highly concentrated sulphuric acid at about $100^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ then respective alkane sulphonic acid is formed.\\
\includegraphics[max width=\textwidth, center]{2025_01_28_8470952b98110cec3aabg-174}\\
(tert. butyl sulphonic acid)\\
(d) Chlorosulphonation/Reaction with $\mathrm{SO}_{2} \& \mathrm{Cl}_{\mathbf{2}}$ (Reed reaction): When propane reacts with $\mathrm{SO}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{Cl}_{2}$ in presence of ultraviolet light then propyl sulphonyl chlorides is formed.\\
\includegraphics[max width=\textwidth, center]{2025_01_28_8470952b98110cec3aabg-174(2)}

This process is used in the commercial formation of detergents.\\
\includegraphics[max width=\textwidth, center]{2025_01_28_8470952b98110cec3aabg-174(1)}\\
3. Oxidation :\\
(a) Complete oxidation or combustion : All alkanes readily burn in excess of air or oxygen to form $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$.\\
$\mathrm{C}_{n} \mathrm{H}_{2 n+2}+\left(\frac{3 n+1}{2}\right) \mathrm{O}_{2} \longrightarrow n \mathrm{CO}_{2}+(n+1) \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}+$ heat\\
$\frac{\text { Volume of alkane }}{\text { Volume of oxygen }}=\frac{2}{3 n+1}$\\
Ex. $\mathrm{CH}_{4}(\mathrm{~g})+2 \mathrm{O}_{2}(\mathrm{~g}) \xrightarrow{\text { Bems }} \mathrm{CO}_{2}(\mathrm{~g})+2 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$\\
(b) Incomplete combustion : Alkanes when burnt in a limited supply of oxygen, partial combustion takes place to give CO or carbon (carbon black).\\
Ex. $2 \mathrm{CH}_{4}+3 \mathrm{O}_{2} \longrightarrow 2 \mathrm{CO}+4 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ + heat\\
$\mathrm{CH}_{4}+\mathrm{O}_{2} \longrightarrow \mathrm{C}+2 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}+$ heat\\
carbon black\\
(c) Catalytic oxidation: $\mathrm{RCH}_{3}+\frac{1}{2} \mathrm{O}_{2} \xrightarrow[250^{\circ} \mathrm{C}, 100 \mathrm{~atm} .]{\mathrm{Cu}} \mathrm{RCH}_{2} \mathrm{OH}$

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \mathrm{RCH}_{3}+\mathrm{O}_{2} \xrightarrow[270^{\circ} \mathrm{C}, 100 \mathrm{~atm} .]{\mathrm{MoO}} \mathrm{RCHO} \\
& \mathrm{RCH}_{3}+\frac{3}{2} \mathrm{O}_{2} \xrightarrow[\text { high temp. }]{\left(\mathrm{CH}_{3} \mathrm{COO}\right)_{2} \mathrm{Mn}} \mathrm{RCOOH}
\end{aligned}
$$

(d) By strong oxidant : Oxidising agents such as $\mathrm{KMnO}_{4}$ readily oxidise a $3^{\circ} \mathrm{H}$ atom to a hydroxy group.\\

Isobutane\\
ter-Butanol\\
4. Pyrolysis/Cracking or Thermal decomposition : The decomposition of a compound by heat is called pyrolysis. In case of alkanes, thermal decomposition is known as cracking. It leads to the formation of lower alkanes, alkenes and hydrogen.\\
Ex. $\mathrm{CH}_{4} \xrightarrow{10000^{\circ} \mathrm{C}} \mathrm{C}+2 \mathrm{H}_{2}$ carbon black (used for printing)

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \mathrm{CH}_{3}-\mathrm{CH}_{3} \xrightarrow{\Delta} \mathrm{CH}_{2}=\mathrm{CH}_{2}+\mathrm{H}_{2} \\
& \mathrm{CH}_{2}=\mathrm{CH}_{2}+\mathrm{CH}_{4} \stackrel{400-600^{\circ} \mathrm{C}}{\longleftrightarrow} \mathrm{CH}_{3}-\mathrm{CH}_{2}-\mathrm{CH}_{3} \xrightarrow{400-600^{\circ} \mathrm{C}} \mathrm{CH}_{3}-\mathrm{CH}=\mathrm{CH}_{2}+\mathrm{H}_{2}
\end{aligned}
$$

\begin{enumerate}
  \setcounter{enumi}{4}
  \item Isomerisation : Straight chain alkanes are converted into their branched chain isomers when heated in presence of $\mathrm{AlCl}_{3}$ at $300^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$.
\end{enumerate}

Ex.\\

\includegraphics[max width=\textwidth, center]{2025_01_28_8470952b98110cec3aabg-175(2)}

\includegraphics[max width=\textwidth, center]{2025_01_28_8470952b98110cec3aabg-175(3)}\\
7. Aromatization, hydroforming or catalytic reforming: The conversion of aliphatic compound intoaromatic compound is referred to as aromatization. Alkanes having six or more carbon atoms are heated at $600^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ in presence of a catalyst such as $\mathrm{Cr}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{3}$ supported over alumina or Pt , these are converted into aromatic hydrocarbons.

Ex. (i)\\
\includegraphics[max width=\textwidth, center]{2025_01_28_8470952b98110cec3aabg-176(3)}\\
(ii)\\
\includegraphics[max width=\textwidth, center]{2025_01_28_8470952b98110cec3aabg-176(2)}

\end{center}

Geometrical isomerism in alkenes: Due to restricted rotation caused by the presence of $\mathrm{C}=\mathrm{C}$ double bond in alkenes, they exhibit geometrical isomerism.\\
The first two members of the alkene series (ethene and propene) do not show geometrical isomerism. Four or more carbon containing alkenes show geometrical isomerism. Alkenes, having general formula $a b \mathrm{C}=\mathrm{C} a b, a b \mathrm{C}=\mathrm{C} d e$ or $a b \mathrm{C}=\mathrm{Cad}$ only exhibit geometrical isomerism.\\
When the identical groups attached to both the doubly bonded carbon atom lie on the same side of the double bond, then this is known as 'cis' isomer, but if these groups are present in the opposite side then it is known as 'trans' isomer.\\
For example : (i) 2-Butene has two geometrical isomers\\
(ii) 2-Pentene has following two geometrical isomers:\\
\includegraphics[max width=\textwidth, center]{2025_01_28_8470952b98110cec3aabg-176(1)}

The two geometrical isomers of alkenes can be distinguished on the basis of the value of their dipole moment ( $\mu$ ). For example, the value of $\mu$ for the cis isomer of 2-butene is 0.4 D and the value of $\mu$ for the trans-isomer of 2 -butene is 0.0 D . It means that trans-2-butene is non-polar.\\
Stability of alkenes : Stability of alkenes can be explained on the basis of hyperconjugation. Hyperconjugation is a kind of resonance which takes place in a molecule by the breaking of the $\mathrm{C}-\mathrm{H} \sigma$ bond. In hyperconjugation, the number of resonating structures, depends upon the number of $\alpha$-hydrogen atoms. In alkenes, the carbon atom next to the double bond is called $\alpha$-carbon atom and the hydrogens attached to it are called $\alpha$-hydrogens. Therefore, alkenes which contain more number of $\alpha$-hydrogen atoms are more stable.\\

Reactivity of alkyl halides: (a) $3^{\circ}>2^{\circ}>1^{\circ}$ halide\\
(b) $\mathrm{R}-$ I $>\mathrm{R}-\mathrm{Br}>\mathrm{RCl}>\mathrm{RF}$

Saytzeff's rule : According to this rule, "the dehydrohalogenation of an alkyl halide results preferentially in the production of more alkylated alkene, i.e., more stable alkene."\\
Ex. Sec-butyl bromide can undergo dehydrohalogenation in two ways forming two isomeric alkenes.\\

\section*{PHYSICAL PROPERTIES OF ALKENES:}
(i) Alkenes from $\mathrm{C}_{2}-\mathrm{C}_{4}$ are colourless, odourless gases, from $\mathrm{C}_{5}-\mathrm{C}_{17}$ they are colourless liquids, $\mathrm{C}_{18}$ onwards alkenes are solids.\\
(ii) Alkenes are practically insoluble in water because they can not form hydrogen bonds with $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ molecules. They dissolve freely in organic solvents like benzene, chloroform, $\mathrm{CCl}_{4}$, petroleum ether., etc.\\
(iii) The boiling and melting points of alkenes are slightly higher than the corresponding alkanes because the intermolecular forces of attraction are stronger due to the presence of easily polarizable $\pi$ bond, alkenes are therefore lesser volatile than the corresponding alkanes.\\
Their boiling points, melting points and specific gravities rise with the increase of molecular weight. The increase in branching in carbon chain decreases the boiling point among isomeric alkenes.

Heat of hydrogenation : The amount of heat liberated in the hydrogenation of one mole of alkene is known as heat of hydrogenation. Hydrogenation of alkenes is an exothermic process.\\

Reactivity order of halogens is $\Rightarrow \mathrm{Cl}_{2}>\mathrm{Br}_{2}>\mathrm{I}_{2}$\\
A $5 \%$ solution of $\mathrm{Br}_{2}$ in $\mathrm{CCl}_{4}$ solvent is used for the detection of $>\mathrm{C}=\mathrm{C}<$ bond since red brown colour of $\mathrm{Br}_{2}$ is discharged due to the formation of a colourless compound. Addition of halogens on alkenes is an example of electrophilic addition. It takes place via the formation of a carbocation. It is evidenced by the fact that when ethylene is treated with bromine water containing NaCl dissolved in it, we get a mixture of ethylene bromide, ethylene bromohydrin and 1-bromo-2-chloroethane.\\

Order of reactivity of $\mathrm{HX} \Rightarrow \mathrm{HI}>\mathrm{HBr}>\mathrm{HCl}>\mathrm{HF}$.\\
Addition of HX on unsymmetrical alkenes $\left(\mathrm{R}-\mathrm{CH}=\mathrm{CH}_{2}\right)$ takes place according to Markownikoff's rule.

Markownikoff's rule: The electrophile adds to the $s p^{2}$ carbon that is bonded to the greater number of hydrogens.\\

Peroxide effect, Anti-Markownikoff's addition :- (Deviation from Markownikoff's rule). The addition of HBr on propylene in presence of sunlight, air or an organic peroxide produces mainly n-propyl bromide instead of isopropyl bromide. Thus, the addition of HBr under these conditions occurs contrary to Markownikoff s rule. This phenomena of abnormal addition of HBr on unsymmetrical alkenes is known as peroxide effect or Kharasch effect. In presence of organic peroxides, addition of HBr takes place by a free radical mechanism as follows :\\

The hydrogen peroxide formed in the reaction is removed by adding zinc dust because it being an oxidising agent may oxidize aldehydes into carboxylic acids. Ozonolysis of alkene offers a valuable method of detection and location of double bonds in complex organic molecules. For knowing the ozonolysis products of an alkene, remove the $>\mathrm{C}=\mathrm{C}<$ bond and add oxygen atom ' O ' on both the doubly bonded carbon atoms.\\

3 Acidic nature of alkynes: Hydrogen atom attached to carbon of the triple bond in terminal alkynes is acidic in nature, and this can be replaced by any metal ion. In alkynes, owing to sp hybridization of the triply bonded carbon atom the $s p$ hybrid orbital of carbon has $50 \% s$ character, therefore the pair of bonding electrons of the carbon-hydrogen bond $(\equiv \mathrm{C}-\mathrm{H}$ ) is more close to carbon, thus the triply bonded carbon atom behaves as a more electronegative atom and in reaction it gives $\mathrm{H}^{+}$ion after breaking carbon-hydrogen $(\equiv \mathrm{C}-\mathrm{H})$ bond and thus shows acidic behaviour. Except 1alkynes, other alkynes, has no hydrogen atom on the triply bonded carbon atom, therefore these do not show acidic character\\
$\mathrm{R}-\mathrm{C} \equiv \mathrm{C}-\mathrm{H} \rightarrow \mathrm{R}-\mathrm{C} \equiv \mathrm{C}^{-}+\mathrm{H}^{+}$\\
Some characteristic substitution reactions and reactions showing acidic character are as follows.\\
(i) Formation of sodium salt : Terminal alkynes (1-alkynes) react with sodium metal in liquid ammonia to give sodium alkynides.

\begin{verbatim}
$\mathrm{R}-\mathrm{C} \equiv \mathrm{C}-\mathrm{H}+\mathrm{Na} \xrightarrow{\text { Liquid } \mathrm{NH}_{3}} \mathrm{R}-\mathrm{C} \equiv \mathrm{C}^{-} \mathrm{Na}^{+}+1 / 2 \mathrm{H}_{2}$
\end{verbatim}

Sodium salts can also be prepared by the reaction of sodamide.

$$
\mathrm{R}-\mathrm{C} \equiv \mathrm{C}-\mathrm{H}+\mathrm{NaNH}_{2} \longrightarrow \mathrm{R}-\mathrm{C} \equiv \mathrm{C}^{-} \mathrm{Na}^{+}+\mathrm{NH}_{3}
$$

(ii) Formation of silver salt : 1-Alkynes react with ammonical silver nitrate solution $\left(\mathrm{AgNO}_{3}+\mathrm{NH}_{4} \mathrm{OH}\right)$ to give white precipitate of silver alkynide.

$$
\mathrm{CH} \equiv \mathrm{CH}+2 \mathrm{AgNO}_{3}+2 \mathrm{NH}_{4} \mathrm{OH} \longrightarrow \mathrm{Ag}^{+} \mathrm{C}^{-} \equiv \mathrm{C}^{-} \mathrm{Ag}^{+}+2 \mathrm{NH}_{4} \mathrm{NO}_{3}+2 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}
$$

\section*{Silver acetylide}
This reaction is used for the test of $-\mathrm{C} \equiv \mathrm{CH}$ group. Thus 1-alkynes can be distinguished from other alkynes by this test. For example, 1-butyne gives this test but 2-butyne does not give this test. Apart from this, with the help of this reaction, 1-alkynes can be purified and separated from alkenes and alkanes.\\
(iii) Formation of copper salt : 1-Alkynes react with ammonical cuprous chloride solution $\left(\mathrm{Cu}_{2} \mathrm{Cl}_{2}+\mathrm{NH}_{4} \mathrm{OH}\right)$ at room temperature to give red precipitate of cuprous alkynide.

$$
\mathrm{CH} \equiv \mathrm{CH}+2 \mathrm{Cu}_{2} \mathrm{Cl}_{2}+2 \mathrm{NH}_{4} \mathrm{OH} \rightarrow \mathrm{Cu}^{+} \mathrm{C}^{-} \equiv \mathrm{C}^{-} \mathrm{Cu}^{+}+2 \mathrm{NH}_{4} \mathrm{Cl}+2 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}
$$

Cuprous acetylide (red ppt)\\
(iv) Reaction with Grignard reagent:1-Alkynes react with Grignard reagent to form alkanes. In this reaction, hydrogen of 1-alkyne is displaced by magnesium.\\
$\mathrm{R}-\mathrm{C} \equiv \mathrm{CH}+\mathrm{CH}_{3} \mathrm{MgBr} \rightarrow \mathrm{R}-\mathrm{C} \equiv \mathrm{C}-\mathrm{MgBr}+\mathrm{CH}_{4}$\\
The alkynyl magnesium halide obtained in the reaction can be used in the preparation of higher alkynes.

$$
\mathrm{R}-\mathrm{C} \equiv \mathrm{CMgBr}+\mathrm{BrR} \longrightarrow \mathrm{R}-\mathrm{C} \equiv \mathrm{C}-\mathrm{R}+\mathrm{MgBr}_{2}

\section*{DIENES OR ALKADIENES}
They contain two $>\mathrm{C}=\mathrm{C}<$ bonds. General formula $\mathrm{C}_{n} \mathrm{H}_{2 n-2}$. Their IUPAC name is alkadiene. Alkadienes are functional isomers of alkynes.\\
Types of alkadienes : Depending upon the position of $>\mathrm{C}=\mathrm{C}<$ bonds in the carbon chain, dienes are of following types.\\
(a) Cumulative diene : In these dienes, double bonds are present on adjacent carbon atoms.\\
Ex.\\
$\mathrm{CH}_{2}=\mathrm{C}=\mathrm{CH}_{2}$\\
$\mathrm{CH}_{2}=\mathrm{C}=\mathrm{CH}-\mathrm{CH}_{3}$\\
Allene or 1, 2-Propadiene\\
1,2-Butadiene\\
(b) Isolated dienes: In these dienes, the double bonds are separated by two or more $\mathrm{C}-\mathrm{C}$ bonds.

Ex.

$$
\mathrm{CH}_{2}=\mathrm{CH}-\mathrm{CH}_{2}-\mathrm{CH}=\mathrm{CH}_{2}, \mathrm{CH}_{2}=\mathrm{CH}-\mathrm{CH}_{2}-\mathrm{CH}_{2}-\mathrm{CH}=\mathrm{CH}_{2}
$$

1,4 -Pentadiene 1,5 -Hexadiene\\
(c) Conjugated dienes: The dienes in which double bonds are present in alternate manner are called conjugated dienes.

1,3-Butadiene\\
2-Methyl-1,3-butadiene\\
Stability of conjugated dienes : Conjugated dienes are more stable than non-conjugated dienes. This can be explained on the basis of hybridization and resonance. All the carbon atoms in a conjugated diene e.g., 1,3-butadiene are $s p^{2}$ hybridized. The delocalization of $\pi$ electrons gives rise to resonance in the molecule which leads to more stability than the corresponding nonconjugated diene.\\

How will you separate a mixture of ethane, ethylene and acetylene?\\
Sol. The separation of the constituents from the mixture can be done in the following steps:\\
Step I. Treat mixture of the gases with an aqueous solution with ammoniacal cuprous chioride solution when acetylene reacts to form a red precipitate of dicopper acetylide whilecthenw and ethylene remain in the gaseous state.

$$
\begin{array}{cc}
\underset{\text { Acetylene }}{\mathrm{H}-\mathrm{C}-\mathrm{H}}+\underset{\text { Ammoniacal }}{2\left[\mathrm{Cu}\left(\mathrm{NH}_{3}\right)_{2}\right] \mathrm{OH}} \rightarrow \quad \text { CuC } \equiv \mathrm{CCu}+4 \mathrm{NH}_{3}+2 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O} \\
& \text { Dicopper acetylide } \\
\text { cuprous chioride } & \text { (Red ppt.) }
\end{array}
$$

Separate the red precipitate by filtration and treat the same with an aqueous HCl to regenerate vapours of acetylene. $\mathrm{CuC} \equiv \mathrm{CCu}+2 \mathrm{HCl} \longrightarrow \mathrm{HC} \equiv \mathrm{CH}+2 \mathrm{CuCl}$

\section*{Cuprous chioride}

An alkyne (a) with molecular $\mathrm{C}_{5} \mathrm{H}_{8}$ reacts neither with sodamide nor with ammoniacal cuprous chloride. Assign structure to the compound (a).\\
Sol. The compound with molecular formula $\mathrm{C}_{5} \mathrm{H}_{8}$ is an alkyne. As it does not react with sodamide or ammoniacal cuprous chloride, this means that it is not acidic in nature and is, therefore, a non-terminal alkyne.

\section*{Ozonolysis is not used for elucidating the structure of alkynes. Why?}
Sol. Alkynes have a triple bond ( $\mathrm{C} \equiv \mathrm{C}$ ) in their molecules. Reaction with ozone results in the formation of an ozonide. Now treatment with zinc dust and water does not cleave the triple bond completely. Therefore, a mixture of two carbonyl compounds is not formed. In other words, alkynes do not undergo complete cleavage in the same way as alkenes.\\

\section*{AROMATIC HYDROCARBONS}
(Aromatic $\longrightarrow$ Aroma (Greek word) $\longrightarrow$ "Sweet smell")\\
Aromatic compounds are those compounds which in their structure have at least one unsaturated ring in which $\pi$ electrons are continuously delocalised in cycic fashion.\\
Characteristics of aromatic compounds :

\begin{enumerate}
  \item The ratio of weights of carbon to hydrogen are very high as compared to the respective aliphatic compounds. Therefore, aromatic compounds burn with smoky flame.
  \item In aromatic compounds the ring may be composed of $3,5,6,7$ atoms and these are in flat or planar geometry.
  \item The aromatic compounds although unsaturated show unexpected stability and resistance towards addition reactions. This character is called "aromaticity".
  \item The aromatic compounds undergo substitution more readily than the addition reactions.
  \item High stability of aromatic compounds is explained on the basis of hydrogenation energy.
\end{enumerate}

Heat of hydrogenation of a $\mathrm{C}=\mathrm{C}$ bond $\Rightarrow 28.6 \mathrm{kcal} / \mathrm{mol}$\\
So heat of hydrogenation of benzene (having three $\mathrm{C}=\mathrm{C}$ ) should be $=85.8 \mathrm{kcal} / \mathrm{mol}$\\
But in actual it is $=49.8 \mathrm{kcal} / \mathrm{mol}$\\
Difference in energies $=36.0 \mathrm{kcal} / \mathrm{mol}$\\
This difference of energy is the resonance energy of benzene which is used in stabilisation of benzene.\\
6. Aromatic compounds have the cyclic system and contain $(4 n+2) \pi$ electrons [Huckel's rule]\\
when $n=0,1,2,3,4$ $\qquad$\\
Hence delocalisation alone is not sufficient criterion for aromaticity,\\
Ex. When $n=0 \quad \pi \mathrm{e}^{-}=4(0)+2=2$\\
\includegraphics[max width=\textwidth, center]{2025_01_28_8470952b98110cec3aabg-201(1)}

8. Nitration of compounds takes place by nitronium ion $\left(\mathrm{NO}_{2}\right)$.\\
9. Halogenation of compounds takes place by halonium ion $(\underset{\mathrm{X}}{\oplus}$.\\
10. Sulphonation of compounds takes place by neutral electrophile, sulphur trioxide $\left(\mathrm{SO}_{3}\right)$.\\
11. A monosubstituted derivative of benzene is found in only one form i.e., it can not show positional isomerism on the ring.\\

12. A disubstituted derivative of benzene is found in three positional isomeric forms, which are called ortho (o-), meta ( $m-$ ), para ( $p-$ ) disubstituted derivatives of benzene.\\

13. All the six carbon of benzene ring are in $s p^{2}$ hybridisation state and all $C-C$ bond lengths have a value of $1.397 \AA$. The value of all the six $\mathrm{C}-\mathrm{H}$ bond lengths is 1.09 A and the molecule has planar hexagonal geometry. The value of all bond angles is $120^{\circ}$.\\
14. There are total twelve $\sigma$ bonds and the $\pi$-honde in benzene molecule. These three $\pi$-bonds are distributed over all the six carbon atoms.

\section*{MEIHODS OF PREPARATION:}

Light oil has at least $60-65 \%$ benzene. Alkaline impurities (aniline, pyridine, quinoline, etc.) are removed by washing light oil with cold and conc. $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{SO}_{4}$.\\
\includegraphics[max width=\textwidth, center]{2025_01_28_8470952b98110cec3aabg-204(5)}

The acidic impurities are removed by washing with dilute NaOH solution. After that NaOH is removed by washing with water. Three fractions are obtained at different temperature range by fractional distillation of neutral oil.

\begin{enumerate}
  \item $90 \%$ Benzol\\
$\left(80-110^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\right)$

Among these $90 \%$ benzol contains about $70 \%$ benzene, $4-14 \%$ toluene and remaining xylene and other hydrocarbons. Fractional distillation gives: Benzene at $80^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, Toluene at $110^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ and Mixture of Benzene/Toluene/Xylene at 137 to $145^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$.

\includegraphics[max width=\textwidth, center]{2025_01_28_8470952b98110cec3aabg-206}

Although benzene and alkenes, both react with anelectrophile to form carbocation, benzene mainly gives electrophilic substitution while alkenes mainly undergo electrophilic addition because in alkenes carbocation formed combines with nucleophile to form the addition product while in benzene carbocation nucleophile removes proton to form substitution product as to maintain the aromatic character.\\
\includegraphics[max width=\textwidth, center]{2025_01_28_8470952b98110cec3aabg-206(3)}\\
(a) The carbocation in benzene is stable due to resonance but carbocation in alkenes is unstable.\\
(b) The arbocation formed by alkenes usually combines with the nucleophile to form the addition product, while nucleophile removes a proton from benzene carbocation to form substitution product.\\

\section*{DIRECTIVEINFLUENCE OF SUBSTITUENTS}
In monosubstitution reactions of benzene, only one monosubstituted product is formed because all the positions in the ring are identical. Any of them can be occupied by the substituent. But in case of disubstitution, three isomeric products are possible. These are ortho $(o)$, meta $(m)$ and para $(p)$.\\
\includegraphics{smile-ebc102db93184437f7534f0f7aec80f4583d91df}\\
\includegraphics{smile-93e3a2caa2454901c6b47eb7052a352ecd6fce90}\\
\includegraphics{smile-f2b77f49e57793b96f91d18be989a1018c35f4a2}

Monosubstitued benzene\\
ortho, meta and para disubstituted benzenes

It may be noted that the position to be occupied by the second entering group depends upon the nature of the group already present. In other words, the group already present in the ring directs the new group to a particular position (ortho, meta or para). This is known as the directive influence. In general, the groups have been classified into two types:\\
(i) Ortho and para directing groups\\
(ii) Meta directing groups\\
(i) Ortho and para directing groups:-

It has been observed that a group which directs the new coming group to ortho position in the ring also directs the same to the para position. In other words, a mixture of isomeric products is formed. For example,\\
\includegraphics[max width=\textwidth, center]{2025_01_28_8470952b98110cec3aabg-212(1)}

$$
\text { _- } \mathrm{NH}_{2}, \stackrel{\mathrm{~N}}{\mathrm{HR}},-\ddot{\mathrm{N}}_{2},-\underset{\mathrm{O}}{ } \mathrm{O}_{,} \ddot{\mathrm{X}}:,-\mathrm{R}(\text { alkyl })
$$

Explanation for the directive influence : With the exception of alkyl group, all other groups have at least one lone pair of electrons on the atom directly attached to the ring. Thus it is in conjugation with the $\pi$-electron system present in the ring and hence involved in resonance. As a result, the ortho and para positions in the ring become the points of high electron density or negatively charged. The new entering group which is an electrophile will hence prefer to go to ortho and para positions rather than the meta position in the ring. Let us illustrate the directive influence of the amino ( $-\mathrm{N}_{2}$ ) group.\\
\includegraphics[max width=\textwidth, center]{2025_01_28_8470952b98110cec3aabg-212}

Since the ring gets highly activated due to increase in electron density, disubstitution in this case readily takes place even at room temperature.\\
Exception: The activating influence is not so marked when a halogen such as chlorine is present in the ring. Although it has a very strong resonance effect ( +Reffect ), it has also a strong -I effect. The latter tends to deactivate the ring and hence the ortho and para disubstitution does not take place at room temperature but at elevated temperature.\\
Directive influence of alkyl group :\\
The alkyl group (R) does not have a lone pair of electrons. Its directive influence is explained with the help of hyperconjugation. This is shown with the help of methyl $\left(\mathrm{CH}_{3}\right)$ group in toluene.\\
\includegraphics[max width=\textwidth, center]{2025_01_28_8470952b98110cec3aabg-212(2)}

In most of the cases, the para isomer is formed in greater proportion as compared to the ortho isomer. This is probably due to the reason that the new entering group experiences greater steric hindrance at the ortho position by the group already present in the ring as compared to the para position. Therefore, it prefers to occupy the para position which is less sterically hindered.\\
(ii) Meta directing groups: A group has a meta directing influence in case the atom of the group which is directly attached to the ring has a more electronegative atom linked to it by multiple bond. The list of some common meta directing groups is.

$$
-\mathrm{CHO},-\mathrm{COOH},-\mathrm{NO}_{2},-\mathrm{CN},-\mathrm{SO}, \mathrm{H} \text { etc. }
$$

Explanation for the directive influence: In this case, under the influence of the attacking electrophile, the ortho and para positions in the ring get positively charged because of conjugation with the electron withdrawing group. This is illustrated with the help of benzaldehyde in which - CHO group is an electron withdrawing group. The resonating structures for the molecule are\\
\includegraphics[max width=\textwidth, center]{2025_01_28_8470952b98110cec3aabg-213(1)}

The meta positions become comparatively the centre of high electron density. Therefore, the attacking electrophile will prefer to attack the meta position and the disubstitution is meta in nature. For example,\\
\includegraphics[max width=\textwidth, center]{2025_01_28_8470952b98110cec3aabg-213}

Benzaldehyde\\
$m$-Nitrobenzaldehyde\\
Since the ring has been i eactivated because of electron withdrawing group, the disubstitution in the ring is not so easy and usually takes place under drastic conditions.\\
Summary: An ortho and para directing group activates the ring towards electrophilic substitution. A meta directing group deactivates the ring towards electrophilic substitution.\\

(i) As an industrial solvent\\
(ii) In dry cleaning.\\
(iii) As a constituent of power alcohol $\mathrm{C}_{2} \mathrm{H}_{5} \mathrm{OH}+\mathrm{C}_{6} \mathrm{H}_{6}+$ Petrol\\

(v) As a fuel.

\section*{[Baticy 12 :}
What are the necessary conditions for any compound to show aromaticity?\\
Sol. According to the modern theory of aromaticity, any compound showing aromatic character should satisfy the following conditions.\\
(i) It should have a conjugated cyclic structure containing $4 n+2$ (where $n=1,2, \ldots \ldots$.) delocalised $\pi$-electrons. This is called Huckel rule.\\
(ii) It should be planar to allow cyclic overlap of the p-orbitals.

\section*{Fammand 13:}
Why does benzene undergo electrophilic substitution reactions easily and nucleophilic substitutions with difficulty?\\
Sol. Benzene due to the presence of delocalised $\pi$-electrons above and below the plane of the ring, provides a centre of attack by an electrophile, thereby giving electrophilic substitution easily.\\
The $\pi$-electron clouds above and below the plane of the ring repel the nucleophile and the leaving group would be a very strong base, i.e., hydride ion. This is why benzene does not undergo nucleophilic substitution reactions under normal conditions.

\section*{Exanilay 14 :}

(ii) The given compounds are,\\
\includegraphics[max width=\textwidth, center]{2025_01_28_8470952b98110cec3aabg-216}

The $-\mathrm{CH}_{3}$ group is an activating group, whereas $-\mathrm{NO}_{2}$ group is a deactivating group So, the presence of $-\mathrm{CH}_{3}$ group favours electrophilic substitution whereas the presence of $-\mathrm{NO}_{2}$ group lowers reactivity towards electrophilic substitution. Therefore, the order of decreasing relative reactivity in the given compounds is\\
$p-\mathrm{CH}_{3} \cdot \mathrm{C}_{6} \mathrm{H}_{4} \cdot \mathrm{CH}_{3}>\mathrm{C}_{6} \mathrm{H}_{5} \cdot \mathrm{CH}_{3}>p-\mathrm{CH}_{3} \mathrm{C}_{6} \mathrm{H}_{4} \cdot \mathrm{NO}_{2}>p-\mathrm{NO}_{2} \cdot \mathrm{C}_{6} \mathrm{H}_{4} \cdot \mathrm{NO}_{2}$\\

Will the reaction proceed as mentioned? Explain your answer. If your answer is ' ${ }^{\prime}{ }^{\prime}$ ' then give the correct product of the reaction.\\
Sol. During the stabilization of the carbocation, $1^{\circ}$ carbocation with $2 \alpha$-hydrogens undergoes a $1,2 \mathrm{H}^{-}$shift to form a $2^{\prime \prime}$ carbocation with $5 \alpha$-hydrogens. Now this carbocation will not rearrange further. If rearranges it will rearrange to a $2^{\circ}$ carbocation with $2 \alpha$-hydrogens which will be less stable. Hence, the reaction will not proceed as shown. Instead, the following reaction will take place.\\

(3) $\mathrm{CH}_{3}-\mathrm{CH}_{2} \mathrm{Cl}+2 \mathrm{Na}+\mathrm{Cl}-\mathrm{CH}_{2}-\mathrm{CH}_{3}$ $\rightarrow \mathrm{CH}_{3}-\mathrm{CH}_{2}-\mathrm{CH}_{2}-\mathrm{CH}_{3}$\\

(9) (b). In the above reaction the energy required to break a hydrogen-hydrogen bond is $104 \mathrm{kcal} /$ mole and the energy required to break a $\pi$ bond of alkyne is $40 \mathrm{kcal} / \mathrm{mole}$.\\
So, the total energy released is $144 \mathrm{kcal} /$ mole. The energy released in the formation of two sigma bonds is $174 \mathrm{kcal} \mathrm{mole}^{-1}$. So the net released energy is $30 \mathrm{kcal} / \mathrm{mole}$ (i.e., in one step, in fornnation of alkane from alkene). This is called heat of hydrogenation (i.e. exothermic reaction).\\
(10) (a). Decarboxylation is $\mathrm{S}_{\mathrm{E}} 1$ reaction which proceed via carbanion\\

(13) (a). Formation of white ppt. with ammonical $\mathrm{AgNO}_{3}$ indicates that the compound is a terminal alkyne.\\
(14) (c). Reactivity of alkenes decreases with increase in carbon chain or no. of carbon atoms in alkene. Reactivity also decreases by substitution of H atom attached to $\mathrm{C}=\mathrm{C}$ double bond.\\
(a). ${ }^{-} \mathrm{CH}_{2}=\stackrel{2}{\mathrm{C}} \mathrm{H}-\stackrel{3}{\mathrm{C}} \mathrm{H}=\stackrel{4}{\mathrm{C}} \mathrm{H}_{2}$.

In it, the single $\mathrm{C}-\mathrm{C}$ bond length between $\mathrm{C}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{C}_{3}$ is $1.46 \AA$ (Intermediate between C-C single bond length of $1.54 \AA$ and $C=C$ bond length of $1.34 \AA$ ).\\
The bond length between $\mathrm{C}_{1}$ and $\mathrm{C}_{2}$ (or $\mathrm{C}_{3}$ and $\mathrm{C}_{4}$ ) is $1.37 \AA$, which is slightly greater than $\mathrm{C}=C$ bond length of $1.34 \AA$.\\
(16) (b). Substitution of $2^{\circ} \mathrm{H}$ will be fast.\\
(17) (c). $\mathrm{Cu}^{+}$ion reacts easily, when $s p$-hybridised carbon has H -atom.\\

$$
2 \mathrm{C}_{3} \mathrm{H}_{8}+10 \mathrm{O}_{2} \longrightarrow 6 \mathrm{CO}_{2}+8 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}
$$

For 1 mole of propane, we have

$$
\mathrm{C}_{3} \mathrm{H}_{8}+5 \mathrm{O}_{2} \longrightarrow 3 \mathrm{CO}_{2}+4 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}
$$

Hence required moles of $\mathrm{O}_{2}=5$.\\
(22)\\
(c). $\frac{\text { Volume of hydrocarbon }}{\text { Volume of } \mathrm{O}_{2}}=\frac{2}{(3 n+1)} \Rightarrow \frac{10}{x}=\frac{2}{7}$\\

(c). For preparing monoalkylbenzene, acylation route is preferred rather than direct alkylation. This is because of the fact that during alkylation, alkyl group is introduced, which being activating group accelerates further alkylation to form di-, tri- and tetraalkyalted products.\\

On the other hand, during acylation we get acylbenzene (e.g. acetylbenzene), acyl group , being deactivating group does not allow further acylation easily. Hence the reaction stops at the monoacyl stage which then can be reduced to alkylbenzene easily.\\

$$

The attack of chlorine atom on the hydrocarbon is selective, that is, a tertiary $\mathrm{C}-\mathrm{H}$ hydrogen atom is abstracted more easily than a secondary or a primary hydrogen. Thus rate of abstraction of hydrogen atom follows the order\\
$3^{\circ}>2^{\circ}>1^{\circ}$.\\
\includegraphics[max width=\textwidth, center]{2025_01_28_8470952b98110cec3aabg-245}

It is likely that the activation energy required to form a $3^{\circ}$ free radical is much less than that for the formation of $2^{\circ}$ or $1^{\circ}$ free radical. The ease of formation of free radicals thus parallels their stability, i.e. $3^{\circ}>2^{\circ}>1^{\circ}$. Thus more stable a free radical, the more easily it is formed.\\
(2) (a,c) (a) is wrong because Wurtz reaction is not applicable for $3^{\circ}$ alkane.\\
(c) is wrong because the addition of $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ on cis alkenes gives meso product.\\

(4) $(a, c)$\\
(5) $\quad(a, b, c)$.\\
(a) The ease of dehydration follows the order:\\
$3^{\circ}$ alcohol $>2^{\circ}$ alcohol $>1^{\circ}$ alcohol.\\
$3^{\circ}$ alcohol, such as tertiary butylalcohol, $\left(\mathrm{CH}_{3}\right)_{3} \mathrm{COH}$ mostly forms 2-butene, $\mathrm{CH}_{3} \mathrm{CH}=\mathrm{CHCH}_{3}$\\
(b) Any strong acid such as HCl or $\mathrm{BF}_{3}$ reacts with alcohols to form alkenes\\
(c) The yield of alkene on dehydrohalogenation of alkyl halides follows the order : $3^{\circ}$ halide $>2^{\circ}$ halide $>1^{\circ}$ halide.\\

( $\mathbf{a}, \mathbf{b}, \mathbf{c}$ ). Because only in HBr the free radical formation is favoured. Free radical formation is not favoured in HCl because the bond energy of $\mathrm{HCl}(430 \mathrm{~kJ})$ is much greater than the bond energy of $\mathrm{HBr}(366 \mathrm{~kJ})$, and disfavours the dissociation into free radicals. In HI, the bond dissociation energy is less than that of HBr , but the addition of large sized iodine atom to a double bond is an endothermic reaction, so less favourable.\\

This is according to Saytzeff rule i.e. the most substituted alkene predominates. 2-Butene is more stable than 1-butene due to presence of large number of hyperconjugating structures in 2-butene.\\
(23)\\
(c). The statement 1 that trans-2 butene reacts with $\mathrm{Br}_{2}$ to produce meso-2, 3-dibromobutane is correct but it does not involve syn-addition of $\mathrm{Br}_{2}$.\\

(5) We know that the branching of the carbon atom chain increases the octane number of the hydrocarbon to be used as a fuel, Although both these compounds are chain isomers, but 2, 2, 3, 3-tetramethylbutane with more branching has higher octane number as compared to 2, 2, 4-trimethylpentane.\\

(6) The bond dissociation of $\mathrm{C}-\mathrm{C}$ bond $\left(355 \mathrm{~kJ} \mathrm{~mol}^{-1}\right)$ is less as compared to that of $\mathrm{C}-\mathrm{H}$ bond $\left(414 \mathrm{kJmol}^{-1}\right)$. Therefore, in cracking of alkanes, generally C-C bonds are cleaved to form smaller molecules.\\
(7) In alkanes, the main attractive forces present in the molecules are weak van der Waal's forces which depend upon the surface area or the size of the molecule. The branching of the carbon chain brings the molecules closer thereby decreasing the surface area and molecular size. Therefore, the branching of the carbon chain decreases the magnitude of the attractive forces. As a result, the branched chain alkanes have less boiling points as compared to straight chain isomers, For example,\\
$\mathrm{CH}_{3}-\mathrm{CH}_{2}-\mathrm{CH}_{2}-\mathrm{CH}_{2}-\mathrm{CH}_{3}$\\
Pentane (b.p. $=309 \mathrm{~K}$ )\\

(8) In the iodination of methane, $\mathrm{H}-\mathrm{I}$ is formed along with iodomethane. Since HI is a strong reducing agent, it reduces iodomethane back to methane and makes the reaction reversible. In order to destroy HI, oxidising agent like $\mathrm{HIO}_{3}$ or $\mathrm{HNO}_{3}$ is needed.

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \mathrm{CH}_{4}+\mathrm{I}_{2} \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{CH}_{3} \mathrm{I}+\mathrm{HI} \\
& \text { Methane } \\
& 5 \mathrm{HI}+\mathrm{HIO}_{3} \rightarrow 3 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}+3 \mathrm{I}_{2}
\end{aligned}

(9) Unsaturation in organic compounds is due to the presence of double or triple bond which are formed by sidewise overlap. Thus they are weak and can easily change to stable $\sigma$-bonds which happens in the addition reactions. Therefore, unsaturated compounds take part in the addition reactions.\\
(10) Alkynes are linear molecules with - $\mathrm{C} \equiv \mathrm{C}$ - bond angle equal to $180^{\circ}$. They do not show any space isomerism or geometrical isomerism.\\
(11) In 1, 2-dichloroethene, the carbon atoms are linked by double bond and the compound can exist as two geometrical isomers, i.e. cis and trans isomers. But the same is not possible in 1,2-dichloroethane in which carbon atoms are linked by single covalent bonds only.\\

(12) In cyclobutane molecule, the $\mathrm{C}-\mathrm{C}$ bond angle is $90^{\circ}$ while it is $60^{\circ}$ in cyclorpopane. This shows that the deviation from the tetrahedral bond angle ( $109^{\circ}-28^{\prime}$ ) in cyclobutane is less than in cyclopropane. In other words, cyclopropane is under greater strain as compared to cyclobutane and is, therefore, more reactive.\\
(13) The structure of the trans isomer is more symmetrical as compared to the cis isomer. In the trans isomer, the dipole moments of the polar $\mathrm{C}-\mathrm{Cl}$ bonds are likely to cancel with each other and the resultant dipole moment of the molecule is nearly zero, But in the cis isomer, these do not cancel. Therefore, the cis isomer has a specific dipole moment but is zero in case of trans isomer.\\
